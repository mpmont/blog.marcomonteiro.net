I"ª<p>Iâ€™m just getting started with Composer. Iâ€™ve been reading a lot about it and I think itâ€™s the way to go. I donâ€™t know many common developers (like me) that are already using it, but Iâ€™m going to give it a go. No more Git articles for you. From now on the two main subjects on my blog will be Composer and Unit Testing, since I decided thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m going to do next.
What is this thing called Composer?</p>
