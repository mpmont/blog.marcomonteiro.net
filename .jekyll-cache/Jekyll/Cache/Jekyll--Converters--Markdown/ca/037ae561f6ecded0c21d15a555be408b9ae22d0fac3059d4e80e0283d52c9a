<p>I‚Äôve been meaning to write this post for a long time now. The problem was I never quite find the right words to do it.</p>

<p>The ‚Äùgo rogue‚Äù philosophy is something that people follow every-time they want something to change. See it as a way to fight the system. 
Imagine you‚Äôre told to do something, something that you know is wrong and there‚Äôs a lot of better ways to do it. You have three options when that happens:
<!--more--></p>

<ul>
  <li>You can shut up and do as you‚Äôre told.</li>
  <li>You can try to make them change their minds into doing the right thing.</li>
  <li>You can do the right thing either way.</li>
  <li>Obviously you should only jump into option number 3 if the second is not an option anymore.</li>
  <li>Let‚Äôs just say there‚Äôs consequences to each one of the roads you take. The first one, will end up biting you in the ass later. Because the more likely thing to happen is you having to do everything again because they realized that you‚Äôre right in the middle of the process.</li>
</ul>

<p>The second option can also have some consequences. You do it a lot of times and you‚Äôll end up being seen as the lone wolf that is always against the system. Hence if you just jump into option two you‚Äôre discrediting yourself. People will think that you‚Äôre being against the system just because you don‚Äôt care or are frustrated about something else.</p>

<p>So the best thing is to try and balance the second and third options. When you have the time to do the right thing and no time to argue with your team during the process just go for the third option and don‚Äôt thing about it. If you have that time, and you are sure you can change everyone‚Äôs minds so try and do it. That way you don‚Äôt have to do this ever again. At least on the subject you‚Äôre discussing.</p>

<p>So going rogue doesn‚Äôt mean to fight against the system for no reason. Is fighting for what you think is right and better for the team. But most of all, it‚Äôs about saving your ass from decisions that will make you re-do stuff a countless number of times.</p>
