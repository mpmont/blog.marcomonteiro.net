I"f<p>Recently I had an invite to Commun.it and I thought to myself, well Iâ€™ve never used a service to manage my community on twitter so I might has well give it a try. Commun.it is basically a service that let you know how to interact better with your community, the users that influence more and the one that you should consider to unfollow and follow.</p>
