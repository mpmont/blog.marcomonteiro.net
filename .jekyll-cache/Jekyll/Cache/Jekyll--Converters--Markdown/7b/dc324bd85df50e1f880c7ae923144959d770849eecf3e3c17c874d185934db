<p>Looks like Iâ€™m on a two week vacation. Nothing better than do a simple check-list for the next two weeks so I donâ€™t end up playing xbox all the time and nothing productive will come out of it.</p>

<p>Since Iâ€™m not going away on actual vacation time this year, this is what Iâ€™ll try to do.

<strong>Fun List:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Get to the end of GTA 4 for xbox. I think I can achieve this in one day.</li>
  <li>Have some beers with the folks at my old place.</li>
  <li>Visit Aveiro for some fun time at the beach.</li>
  <li>Visit Oeiras for some fun time and if the weather allows some beach time too.</li>
  <li>Visit my family. Since Iâ€™m working away from the old place.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Hobby List:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Do a lot of Geocaching</li>
  <li>Make some time for photography. Both normal and Lomo.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Other List:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Making some changes to Admin Base. (CodeIgniter base CMS project for developers)</li>
  <li>Make some progression on my current personal project.</li>
  <li>Advance a bit on my blog postâ€™s here. Already have some almost finished.</li>
  <li>Make some time for DailyPancake.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is my list for the next two weeks. Letâ€™s see if I can get it all done. 
To keep track of all this just follow my Twitter AccountIâ€™ll probably be posting stuff there about all this.</p>
