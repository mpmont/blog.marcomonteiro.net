<p>I used to love Google Analytics, I’ve been using it for all my personal or client projects. However, the “new” version has been pissing me off more than usual. First I never got used to the new layout. Then the non integration with the google account that you normally have active it’s insane. If I have multiple accounts it always makes me logout from all of them and login with just one. If I’m using just one, it always make me hit the login button.</p>

<p>Anyway, long story short I started looking for an alternative. I had two requirements: I wanted to control the updates of the service; and I wanted to be able to use it like the old analytics. Nice and clean.</p>

<p>So I found Piwik Analytics. The first thing I heard while talking to people about this matter was: <em>“why would you bother with Piwik, when you have Google Analytics working fine?”</em> — Like I said, Google Analytics doesn’t work fine.</p>

<p>When you start really looking around you’ll find some stuff that Piwik has that Google Analytics doesn’t.</p>

<ul>
  <li><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Tracking file downloads</li>
  <li><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Tracking outbound links</li>
  <li><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Tracks cart abandonment</li>
  <li><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Handy summaries in the conversion report to quickly figure out what is going on</li>
  <li><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Officially supported Mobile App</li>
  <li><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> They publish a clear and open road map of where the application is going</li>
  <li><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Piwik’s team offers Professional Services to help customize your site for a fee. (You need Google Premium at a $100,000/year to get that)</li>
</ul>

<p>If this is not enough for you, consider this:</p>

<ul>
  <li><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> What if you do not wish to be limited by Google Analytics or their API</li>
  <li><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Is it important to own/control your data?</li>
  <li><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Do you need a tool to collect data so you can create custom dashboards.</li>
</ul>

<p>Personally, having control over my data, and the fact that Google is not using my data for something else it’s more than enough for me to choose Piwik.</p>
