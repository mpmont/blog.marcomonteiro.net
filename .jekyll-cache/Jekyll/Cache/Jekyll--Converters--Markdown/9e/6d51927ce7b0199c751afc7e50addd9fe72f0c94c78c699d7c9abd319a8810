<p>The second day had some really good talks. However thereâ€™s one that want to talk for a bit.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ben Corlett is the lead engineer at Cartalyst, Director of Webcomm and developer for Kapture. His days typically involve a mix of developing the hottest Composer-based PHP packages and applying the theoretical use of the newest technologies, frameworks and code in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Once again the subject was all about composer. But this time it was more about how to build new packages, good practices and whatnot.</p>

<p>One of the things that composer tries to achieve is cross framework code. To achive this you have to follow on simple rule:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your code <strong>must</strong> be framework agnostic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is quite easy to understand. Makes no sense to build Laravel libraries, or Codeigniter libraries. We should be all building packages that can be used by any framework.</p>

<p>One other point that Ben talked a lot was how do you go about making a decision to make a new package. He even made a graph and all.</p>
