<p>I’m just getting started with Composer. I’ve been reading a lot about it and I think it’s the way to go. I don’t know many common developers (like me) that are already using it, but I’m going to give it a go. No more Git articles for you. From now on the two main subjects on my blog will be Composer and Unit Testing, since I decided that’s what I’m going to do next.
What is this thing called Composer?</p>
