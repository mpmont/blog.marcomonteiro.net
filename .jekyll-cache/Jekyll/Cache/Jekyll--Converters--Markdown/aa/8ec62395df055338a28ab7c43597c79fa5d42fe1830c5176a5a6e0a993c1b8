<p>At the end of the first day the legend Fabien Potencier took the stage. If you donâ€™t know who he is, heâ€™s a developer by passion, he started to build websites with PHP5 in 2004 and created the Symfony framework to help SensioLabs, his company, leverage the power of PHP for its customers.</p>

<p>As expected his talk was all about Symfony.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Symfony is all about standardization and interoperability. The Symfony foundation is largely based on existing standards like HTTP, but it also leverages existing best-practices and design patterns like dependency injection. Learn more about the fundamental philosophy of Symfony and why embracing these core concepts is good for PHP as a whole.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After all the talk about standardization there was a really interesting Q&amp;A. Mostly about general PHP stuff and some decisions and the Symfony roadmap.</p>

<p>This is how great Laracon EU is, weâ€™re here not just to talk about Laravel. Mostly weâ€™re were to talk about PHP in general. Actually I talked to a lot of people and most donâ€™t even use Laravel that much. But we all love it and learn from it.</p>
