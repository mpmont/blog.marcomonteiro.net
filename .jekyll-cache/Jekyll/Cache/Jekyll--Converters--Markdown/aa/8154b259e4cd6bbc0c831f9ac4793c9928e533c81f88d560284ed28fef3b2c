I"$<p>Ever since I moved my blog to tumblr I’ve been keeping a close eye on my analytics account. That’s because there’s a lot of articles out there that don’t say good things about tumblr and its power when it comes to SEO.

My blog as been having a fair amount of visits, and for that I must say - Thank you - However, I found something really strange on my analytics page.
The average visit duration could go up to 3 minutes, but at the same time I was getting a extremely high percentage of bounce rate, something like 90%.</p>
