<p>Ever since I moved my blog to tumblr Iâ€™ve been keeping a close eye on my analytics account. Thatâ€™s because thereâ€™s a lot of articles out there that donâ€™t say good things about tumblr and its power when it comes to SEO.

My blog as been having a fair amount of visits, and for that I must say - Thank you - However, I found something really strange on my analytics page.
The average visit duration could go up to 3 minutes, but at the same time I was getting a extremely high percentage of bounce rate, something like 90%.</p>

<p>Well, this didnâ€™t feel right, so I looked at my blog trying to find what could be doing this and I think I found the cause.</p>

<p>The infine scroll in my homepage. People could be scrolling there for minutes while seeing different content but the url would never change.</p>

<p>The way to solve this is quite easy. I just had to write on url the number of the current page the user just â€œenteredâ€.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t have definite proof about this, but Iâ€™m pretty sure my bounce rate is getting lower day by day.</p>

<p>So, if you use infinite scroll in your website you should always send some kind of feedback in your url regarding the â€œpageâ€ the user is currently on.</p>

<p>This post is a small update on my tumblr experience so far.</p>
