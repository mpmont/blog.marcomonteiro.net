I"H<p>This week Gowalla released a new mobile app both for Android and IOS. When I heard this I was so excited. Iâ€™m not using gowalla for that long, I used foursquare when I started checkin into places. But lately I noticed that I had much more real friends on Gowalla than foursquare. So I changed to Gowalla and I love it.</p>
