<p>For a long time Iâ€™ve been using Jamie Rumbelow view presenters and after his presentation at Ciconf (London 2012) I noticed that a lot of people started using his code including my buddy David Wosnitza. After a while David started using the presenters in a even more clever way. He showed me his code and we agreed that it was time to create a library inspired in Jamieâ€™s work.</p>

<p><strong>What is a presenter?</strong></p>

<p>A presenter just another layer of abstraction that works between the Controller and the View.</p>

<p><strong>Why do we need another layer of abstraction?</strong></p>

<p>Because if you donâ€™t you have two options, either you use a good template library, or you end up with messy views and those can be a pain to edit.
I made a small screencast that will help you understand better on how to use the ci-presenter library.</p>

<p>Fork it, add awesomeness to it and help document it. Iâ€™m the one doing all the documentation, so it would be great to have some help on that.</p>
