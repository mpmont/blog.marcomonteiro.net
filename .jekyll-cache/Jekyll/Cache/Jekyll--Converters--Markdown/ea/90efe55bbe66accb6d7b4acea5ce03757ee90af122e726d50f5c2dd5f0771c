<p>That’s right, I finally gave it a go and spent some time with my new mistress. I only played around with it for a few hours and I’m already blogging about it. That’s how cool it is.
Laravel is a clean and classy framework for PHP web development. Freeing you from spaghetti code, Laravel helps you create wonderful applications using simple, expressive syntax. Development should be a creative experience that you enjoy, not something that is painful. Enjoy the fresh air.

That’s the description you’ll see the first time you get to the Laravel website. And I gotta say, they’re not trying to sell you anything, it is actually like that.</p>
