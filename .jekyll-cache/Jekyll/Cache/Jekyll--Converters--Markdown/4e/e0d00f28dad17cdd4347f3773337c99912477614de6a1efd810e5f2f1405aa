I"<p>Iâ€™ve been a full time Linux user for the past 4 years. Until now, all Iâ€™ve used was Debian distributions. I never in my life even consider a Arch based distro because rolling release distros scared me.</p>

<p>However, Manjaro Linux has been getting a lot of buzz in the last 2 or 3 years so I decided to try it out.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was join <a href="https://reddit.com/r/ManjaroLinux">r/ManjaroLinux</a> and I lurked there for about a month or so. Never said anything during that time. Basically to see how many posts were about people saying that the system somehow broke.</p>

<p>I then decided to make a post, <a href="https://reddit.com/r/ManjaroLinux/comments/jj1kby/never_used_a_rolling_release_distribution/">this one</a> to be precise.</p>
