<p>A lot has been going on this year about responsive webdesign. Personally I think this is a great thing that finally webdesigners are awaken for the reality that webdesign can no longer be produced for one platform but for many.</p>

<p>Web have tablets, smartphones, small screen laptops. This verity of platforms makes the job a bit difficult for a webdesigner, but a lot more interesting.

Many webdesigners resolve this issue just by using a grid that can resize it self for all those platforms. But seriously? How responsive is that? I was a purist for a long time now, never used a grid for coding always made the code myself. I found that most of the grids were to generic, a lot of class’s and wrap divs that actually will never be used for nothing.</p>

<p>So after reading <a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/08/23/the-semantic-grid-system-page-layout-for-tomorrow/">this article</a> I was blown away for finally finding a grid that is everything a responsive webdesigner wants.</p>

<p>So go on a try it, I know I’ll be trying it on my next project.</p>
