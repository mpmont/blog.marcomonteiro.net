<p>A few months ago I had a problem. I was paginating some results based on some data the user had provided. So I needed to be able to pass that data from page to page during the pagination process. First I set to read the Codeigniter documentation to see if it was possible to do that with the pagination library.</p>

<p>Turns out I could if I set up that data to be a query string and save it in my suffix param. However this solution had a problem. Every-time the user clicked the first or last link on the pagination the query string would disappear. 
<!--more-->
So I searched some more, and found something even better. The new version of the pagination Library (3.0) already had that feature. So if you ever need it and donâ€™t want to wait for the next version of Codeigniter you just have to do the following.</p>

<p>Download the version 3.0 of the Pagination Library <a href="https://github.com/EllisLab/CodeIgniter/blob/develop/system/libraries/Pagination.php">here</a>.</p>

<p>Extend your current version of the pagination Library with the one that you just downloaded. (see how to do that <a href="http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/general/core_classes.html">here</a>)</p>

<p>As you can see the pagination now has one more param than before. Itâ€™s called reuse_query_string. And just by setting that to TRUE, you can now use both uri segments and query strings in your pagination.</p>
