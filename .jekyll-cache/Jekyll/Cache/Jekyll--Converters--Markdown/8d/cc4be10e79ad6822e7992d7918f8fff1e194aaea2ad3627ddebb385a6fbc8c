I"G<p>If you are following <a href="http://cicon2011.com/">CICON 2011</a> yesterday, then you no doubt already heard from the Reactor team: CodeIgniter is now using Git for source control, and has moved its <a href="https://github.com/EllisLab/CodeIgniter">home to GitHub</a>. Also, CodeIgniter …Core“ is not longer being publicly maintained. CodeIgniter …Reactor“ is CodeIgniter, so we are dropping that suffix. In short: CodeIgniter is the framework, and Reactor is our community driven development program.</p>

<p>Lastly, version 2.0.3 was released today, download it <a href="http://codeigniter.com/download.php">here</a> or from the release tag at GitHub.</p>
