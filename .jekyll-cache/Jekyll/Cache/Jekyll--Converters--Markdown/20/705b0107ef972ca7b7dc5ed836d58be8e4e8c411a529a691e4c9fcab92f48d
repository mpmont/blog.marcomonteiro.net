<p>Do you even know what this means for developers, specially front-end developers that do a lot of responsive webdesign? This means that a little device like that has more pixels than most 27” displays! So we’re heading towards huge images for phones and normal ones for desktops… This. Is. Insane.</p>

<p>Apple’s retina displays is 326ppi and we already have enough trouble with it. This is almost double the size. The web will look awful using this LG screen.</p>
