<p>I’ve been meaning to read this book for a while. I was also postponing that start because I knew one thing - as soon I would start reading I was not going to stop (I was right).</p>

<p>First don’t be afraid, even if you don’t have any knowledge of networking, hacking or something like that you’ll be alright reading this. But still, if you have such skills, don’t worry, the book is entertaining and amazing either way.</p>
