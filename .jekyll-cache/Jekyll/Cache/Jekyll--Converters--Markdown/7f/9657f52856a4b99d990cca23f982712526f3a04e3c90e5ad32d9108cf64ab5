<p>As you may or may not know last week I migrated all my content from tumblr into this new cms called Wardrobe. For now Iâ€™m really happy with it. It gives me total control over my content and it doesnâ€™t have all those features that most blogging platforms have. Features that I never needed in the first place.</p>

<p><strong>What is Wardrobe anyway?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wardrobe is a minimalistic blogging application. Wardrobe attempts to make blogging simple and enjoyable by utilizing the latest technologies and keeping the administration as simple as possible with the primary focus on writing.</p>

<p><strong>What are the main features of this minimalistic blogging application?</strong></p>

<p><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> <strong>Markdown</strong> - All content is stored as markdown so its portable and easy to move in and out.</p>

<p><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> <strong>Schedule Posts</strong> - Write posts and schedule the time and date you want them to appear.</p>

<p><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> <strong>Post Tagging</strong> - Wardrobe allows you to tag posts for categorization and for grouping.</p>

<p><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> <strong>Drag &amp; Drop</strong> - Prefer to write in a native app? With Wardrobe you can drag and drop markdown files into the admin to create posts</p>

<p><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> <strong>Simple Theming</strong> - Wardrobe utilizes a simple but powerful theming system so almost any design can be integrated.</p>

<p><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> <strong>Powerful Routing</strong> - Themes have the power to over ride routes and also create completely new custom ones.</p>
