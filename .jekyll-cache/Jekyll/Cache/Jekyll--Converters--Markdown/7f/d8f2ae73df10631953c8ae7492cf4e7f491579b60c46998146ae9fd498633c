I"e<p>Dear visitor, if you have already subscribed to my rss feed i ask you one small favor: unsubscribe it and subscribe it again from the icon i have at the bottom of the page or use the image from this post.</p>

<p>I’m asking this because i have forgotten to add my feed to feedburner therefore i wasn’t able to monitor your subscriptions. Also now you can see all the post in my feed, because if you are like me you want to be able read almost everything just in your rss client.</p>

<p>I’m very sorry for the inconvenient but i think this will benefit both you and me.</p>

<p>Have a nice Halloween</p>
