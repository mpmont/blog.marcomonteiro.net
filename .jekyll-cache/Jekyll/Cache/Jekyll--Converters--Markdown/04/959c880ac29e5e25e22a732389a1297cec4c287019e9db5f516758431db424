I"v<p>Looks like I’m on a two week vacation. Nothing better than do a simple check-list for the next two weeks so I don’t end up playing xbox all the time and nothing productive will come out of it.</p>

<p>Since I’m not going away on actual vacation time this year, this is what I’ll try to do.

<strong>Fun List:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Get to the end of GTA 4 for xbox. I think I can achieve this in one day.</li>
  <li>Have some beers with the folks at my old place.</li>
  <li>Visit Aveiro for some fun time at the beach.</li>
  <li>Visit Oeiras for some fun time and if the weather allows some beach time too.</li>
  <li>Visit my family. Since I’m working away from the old place.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Hobby List:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Do a lot of Geocaching</li>
  <li>Make some time for photography. Both normal and Lomo.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Other List:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Making some changes to Admin Base. (CodeIgniter base CMS project for developers)</li>
  <li>Make some progression on my current personal project.</li>
