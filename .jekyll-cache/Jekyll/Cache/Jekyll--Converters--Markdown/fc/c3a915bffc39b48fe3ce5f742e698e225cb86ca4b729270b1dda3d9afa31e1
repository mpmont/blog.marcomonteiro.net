<p>Yesterday i went to a conference in Lisbon where i got to see all kinds of peeps interested in usability. Check here the program. I gotta a say the conference was really good and that got me pumped up to build even better applications to get the user the best experience.

The first speaker, Anabela Fernandes told us all about how should we do tests with real people. Although iâ€™ve never donne more than tests with co-workers she really give us good pointers on how to act when to try to test something. On the first break me and Carlos Ceia got to talk with her and ask her some questions, like how do we get people to try our products.</p>
