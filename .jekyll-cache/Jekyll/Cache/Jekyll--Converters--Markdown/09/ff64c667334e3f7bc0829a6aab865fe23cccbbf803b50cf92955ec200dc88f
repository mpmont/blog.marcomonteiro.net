I"÷<p>I used to love Google Analytics, I‚Äôve been using it for all my personal or client projects. However, the ‚Äúnew‚Äù version has been pissing me off more than usual. First I never got used to the new layout. Then the non integration with the google account that you normally have active it‚Äôs insane. If I have multiple accounts it always makes me logout from all of them and login with just one. If I‚Äôm using just one, it always make me hit the login button.</p>
