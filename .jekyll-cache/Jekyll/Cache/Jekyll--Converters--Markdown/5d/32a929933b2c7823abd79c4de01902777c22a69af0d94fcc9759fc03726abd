I"‚<p>Mike Monteiro is a Portuguese/American designer, one of the founders of <a href="http://muledesign.com/">Mule Design</a>. Heâ€™s probably my favorite speaker when it comes to the subject of Design. He wrote one book called <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/design-is-a-job">Design is a Job</a> that I highly recommend.</p>

<p>A few years back he also gave a talk called <a href="https://vimeo.com/22053820">Fuck you, pay me</a>. But this year he gave one called <strong>How Designers Destroyed the World</strong> and itâ€™s amazing. He talks about the responsibility of designers to do the right thing. That design is supposed to be about solving problems and not just about making beautiful things (or yet another camera app).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are directly responsible for what you put into the world. Yet every day designers all over the world work on projects without giving any thought or consideration to the impact that work has on the world around them. This needs to change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if youâ€™re a Designer of any kind, Graphic Designer, Web Designer, UI Designer, UX Designer and so on you <strong>must</strong> watch this.</p>
