<p>CodeIgniter 4 has its own Github repository. It deviates enough from CodeIgniter 3 that the British Columbia Institute of Technology wanted to keep them separate. The CodeIgniter 4 roadmap is explained in the <a href="http://forum.codeigniter.com/forum-27.html">forum</a>, and work to be done is detailed in the <a href="https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter4/issues">repository issues</a>.</p>

<p>Until now, the repository was not accepting merge requests, or as github call them, pull requests. However, thereâ€™s some bits that everyone can contribute it it. So if you have any spare time and want to help out, go to the <a href="https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter4/issues">github page</a> and start helping out with the issues marked as <strong>Help wanted</strong>.</p>
