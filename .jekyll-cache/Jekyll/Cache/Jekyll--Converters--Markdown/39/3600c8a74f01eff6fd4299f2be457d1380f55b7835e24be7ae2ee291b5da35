I"Æ<p>For the last 6 months or so I made it my mission to improve my privacy on the web. This article shows you what changes I made so far and what you can also do to protect yourself.</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 26px;"><strong><u> Stop using google.com</u></strong></h3>

<p>One of the first changed I made was stop myself from using google.com. Google tracks everything you do on the web, all your searchs, but most of all, instead of giving you the results that are more relevant based on their SEO score, they give you the result that they think are best for you. This keeps you from seeing different ideas or even getting into websites that might make more sense to what you look for.</p>

<p>I started using <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo.com instead</a>. They donâ€™t track your searches, and most of all you get unbiased results outside the Filter Bubble. They are committed to unbiased search thatâ€™s never based on your search history.</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 26px;"><strong><u> Stop Using google Chrome</u></strong></h3>

<p>Google chrome has been my default browser for years now. Before that I used Firefox for a long time but I parted ways with it mostly because it was getting behind in features and it was way slower than Chrome.</p>

<p>However, for the same reason I stopped using google.com I thought it was time to give Firefox a try once more. Boy or boy was I impressed.</p>

<p>Firefox is fast, it has all the feature I need in a browser for web-development that I do everyday and in it I installed a bunch of addons that helped further with my quest.</p>

<p><strong>Hereâ€™s a list of Firefox addons I installed realted to privacy.</strong></p>
