<p>Looks like the world didnâ€™t end after all. Iâ€™m disappointed. So whatâ€™s going to happen in 2013?</p>

<p>Hell if I know! Iâ€™m not sure whatâ€™s going to happen around me, so I most certainly donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going to happen in the world.

2012 ended up being good with a small turn in the end (but this wasnâ€™t the only one). It was just a matter of time for this thing called the Economy come and bite me in the ass. I just left the company I was working for. So, starting in January 2013 Iâ€™ll be working fulltime as a freelancer.
Now, thereâ€™s good news and bad news.</p>

<p><strong>First the bad news.</strong></p>

<p>I never done anything like this before and things arenâ€™t that good at the moment where I live (Portugal) so weâ€™ll see how it goes.
Need to take care of those boring tasks attached with this life. Like sending invoices and whatnot. I hate that.
Then the good news.</p>

<p><strong>Working from home.</strong></p>

<p>Donâ€™t need to put up with shit that only happens when you work for someone.
More time to blog (this can be a good thing if that means that I can manage my time properly, or a really bad thing if Iâ€™m doing it because I have too much free time).
Now the best thing is: Iâ€™m already fully booked with work for January and maybe a bit for February, and thatâ€™s going to be my plan for the moment. Live by the month and see how it goes. If I can work this out, I can start thinking about doing this in a more long term. If it doesnâ€™t work, hell Iâ€™m a citizen of the world and Iâ€™ll get a job somewhere else.</p>

<p>For now, 2013, bring it on!</p>
