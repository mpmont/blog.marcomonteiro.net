I"„<p>Need a placeholder? Like kittens? Use Codeigniter?</p>

<p>Well youâ€™ve come to the right place sir. I have just the thing for you. Today edmundask did his own placeholder helper for Codeigniter. When I saw it I just had to make a placeholder with kittens. So I forked his repository and did it.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoy it.</p>
