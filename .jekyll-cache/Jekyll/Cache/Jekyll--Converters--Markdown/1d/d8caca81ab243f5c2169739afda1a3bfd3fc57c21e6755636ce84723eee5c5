<p>We are developers, we have personal websites, blogs and all that. So from time to time, we want to embed in a blog post or any other type of content a bit of code. Thereâ€™s a lot of ways to do so. For instance on my blog I use <a href="http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/">highlight.js</a>. It works fine I donâ€™t have a single complaint about it.</p>
