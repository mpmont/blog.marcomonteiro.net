<p>Glide is responsive and touch-friendly jQuery slider. Based on CSS3 transitions with fallback to older broswers. Itâ€™s simple, lightweight and fast. Designed to slide, no less, no more. A lot has been said this past few weeks about OOCSS markup, JÄ™drzej ChaÅ‚ubek (creator of Glide.js) needed simple and fast slider with fully customizable OOCSS markup. If youâ€™re into OOCSS this is the way to go.</p>
