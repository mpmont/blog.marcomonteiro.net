<p>One of the reasons that made me change from the ubuntu version of gnome to the default one was to actually be able to get the updates for it faster. As of yesterday the new version was out. Version 3.32 contains six months of work by the GNOME community and includes many improvements, performance improvements and new features.</p>

<p>This release features a refreshed visual style ranging from an entirely new set of app icons to improvements to the user interface style. Many of the base style colors have been saturated, giving them a more vivid, vibrant appearance. Buttons are more rounded and have a softer “shadow” border. Switches no longer use the explicit ON and OFF text, instead using color to indicate state.</p>

<p>I haven’t really upgraded but I’m really excited about doing it.</p>
