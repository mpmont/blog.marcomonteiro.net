<p>Over the last month I blogged about a lot of stuff that is related to code versioning in one way or another. I think it‚Äôs clear by now that the best tool out there for that is Git (this is just my humble opinion).</p>

<p>The post called ‚ÄúGit vs SVN is it really a battle?‚Äù created a lot of discussion both on my blog and on forrst and that made me really happy. With all that discussion I noticed something, people that were not using git all said the same thing in one way or another.
Git is hard to learn.

Well I don‚Äôt really agree with that. But now you can learn git in an intuitive way. You don‚Äôt even need to setup anything, just fire-up your browser of choice (if that‚Äôs Internet Explorer, please kill yourself before the tutorial, it‚Äôs the 1st step) and you can start playing around with git.</p>

<p>Remember, all the ladies want these days is a Jedi Git master. So <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git">Try Git</a>.</p>
