I"><p>Ever since I moved into Linux I started using the CLI even more. Don’t get me wrong, I used it quite a lot on Mac. However if there was one thing that I normally didn’t use it for was for mySQL. However a few days ago I discovered <a href="http://www.mycli.net/">mycli</a>. Since then I gotta say. Love it!</p>
