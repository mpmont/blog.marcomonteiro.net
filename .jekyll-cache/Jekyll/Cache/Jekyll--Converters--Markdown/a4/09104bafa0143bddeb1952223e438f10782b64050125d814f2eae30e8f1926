<p>If you are following <a href="http://cicon2011.com/">CICON 2011</a> yesterday, then you no doubt already heard from the Reactor team: CodeIgniter is now using Git for source control, and has moved its <a href="https://github.com/EllisLab/CodeIgniter">home to GitHub</a>. Also, CodeIgniter â€¦Coreâ€œ is not longer being publicly maintained. CodeIgniter â€¦Reactorâ€œ is CodeIgniter, so we are dropping that suffix. In short: CodeIgniter is the framework, and Reactor is our community driven development program.</p>
