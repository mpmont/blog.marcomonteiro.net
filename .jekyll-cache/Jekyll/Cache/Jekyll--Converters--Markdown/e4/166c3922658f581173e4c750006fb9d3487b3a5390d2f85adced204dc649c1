<p>Yeah, thatâ€™s right. If youâ€™re like me you have a small compulsion to commit every small task you complete. In some cases that can be a good practice. However, when youâ€™re working with a large team, or even on a open source project that has lotâ€™s of contributors that can be a PITA in the long run.
