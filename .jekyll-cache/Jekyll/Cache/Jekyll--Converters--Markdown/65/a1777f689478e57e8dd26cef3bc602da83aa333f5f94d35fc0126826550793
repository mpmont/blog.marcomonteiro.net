I"¡<p>Ever since Codeigniter moved from Bitbucket to Github I craved for one easy way to update my applications every time a new version gets out. Turns out there is none. And as you can see here, the updating process is always kinda boring specially if a major version is out. Since the version 3.0 is around the block Iâ€™m going to show you how I normally upgrade my codeigniter applications.

First things first, Iâ€™m assuming that you work with git in your normal day to day workflow. If you donâ€™t use it, or even worst donâ€™t know how to use it, stop reading this and without further delay go learn how to use it. (You can check this link for that!).</p>
