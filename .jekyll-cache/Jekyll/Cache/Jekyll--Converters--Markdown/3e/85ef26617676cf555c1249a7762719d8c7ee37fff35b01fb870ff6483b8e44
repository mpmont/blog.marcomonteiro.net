<p>My tumblr experience ended. It was good while it lasted but we had to part ways. You changed the way people manage and write their posts and I didnâ€™t like that one bit.</p>

<p>Then I found this little project called <a href="http://wardrobecms.com/">Wardrobe</a> built in Laravel 4 and I was in-love. Editor in markdown and a base templates focussed on the reading experience.</p>

<p>Took me one literally one days work to migrate all my articles and comments. First I used the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyllrb</a> plugin to export all my articles from tumblr. Then I imported everything into wardrobe in no time. The comments was the worst part, I had to change all the slugs to match them. After that I was good to go.</p>

<p>Couple of changes to the template and BAM I got myself a blog platform.</p>

<p>Best part is that since itâ€™s built in Laravel 4 I can now play around with it and add more functionality to it.</p>
