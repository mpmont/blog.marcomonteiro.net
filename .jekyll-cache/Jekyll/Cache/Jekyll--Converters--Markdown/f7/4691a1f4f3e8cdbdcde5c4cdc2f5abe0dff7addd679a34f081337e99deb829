I"e<p>A few months back I got me a cheap chinese laptop mostly for email, browsing the web, some light reading and watching some videos.</p>

<p>The laptop came with windows, so the first thing I did was remove it and install Ubuntu. However, performance wise it wasn’t the best. So I tried Lubuntu, but then I found out about Prime OS.</p>

<p>If you already use Android, you’ll love what you can do with PrimeOS. PrimeOS operating system gives a complete desktop experience similar to Windows, MacOS or even Çinux with access to millions of Android apps. It is designed to bring you the best of both worlds - a complete fusion of Android and PC.</p>

<p>You install it just like any other Linux distro, just create a bootable USB stick and you’re good to go. Even has live option so you can try it before installing and check if it’s going to perform well on your machine.</p>

<p>For my everyday laptop use it’s perfect, I already have all my documents on google docs. My main email account is a Google Apps account.</p>
