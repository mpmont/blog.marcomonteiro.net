I"ø<p>When I started using Git I wasnâ€™t doing any version control. I was just working on my projects and I just didnâ€™t see any use to it. I wasnâ€™t seeing the long run. Everything seemed like too much work â€” Branching, staging, stashing, committing â€” I was confused.  But then Git was kind forced on me, since I wanted to contribute to open source projects and almost all of them were (and still are thankfully) using Git I had to learn how to use it. This is what I learned from that process.</p>
