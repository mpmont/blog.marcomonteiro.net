I"‘<p>Ever since I moved away from mac and started using Linux as my daily driver thereâ€™s been a few minor things that I miss obviously. One of the things is that I never really liked the default application launcher for ubuntu. I always loved the default one mac os has that has a lot of built in functionality. Or if you wanted more on mac you could even install Alfred and that was awesome too.</p>
