I"+<p>One of the things that happens to me a lot is when I start a new project on my computer that someone else started on our main repo  is this error saying that I’m trying to merge unrelated histories.</p>

<p>This happens mostly because someone on the other side already started the master and develop branch and made some commits to it.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>However what I normally do is:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git init
$ git flow init
$ git remote add origin [insert url here]
$ git pull origin develop
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is when everything turns to shit and I get the following output:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories
$ Error redoing merge 1234deadbeef1234deadbeef
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However this is quite easy to solve. All you have to do is shove a <em>–allow-unrelated-histories</em> into your pull command. Like so:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git pull origin develop --allow-unrelated-histories
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will also work if you’re trying to merge or rebase code.</p>
