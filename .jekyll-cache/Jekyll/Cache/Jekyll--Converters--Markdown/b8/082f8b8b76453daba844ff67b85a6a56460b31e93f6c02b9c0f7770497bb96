I"°<p>Iâ€™ve been a full time Linux user for the past 4 years. Until now, all Iâ€™ve used was Debian distributions. I never in my life even consider a Arch based distro because rolling release distros scared me.</p>

<p>However, Manjaro Linux has been getting a lot of buzz in the last 2 or 3 years so I decided to try it out.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was join <a href="https://reddit.com/r/ManjaroLinux">r/ManjaroLinux</a> and I lurked there for about a month or so. Never said anything during that time. Basically to see how many posts were about people saying that the system somehow broke.</p>

<p>I then decided to make a post, <a href="https://reddit.com/r/ManjaroLinux/comments/jj1kby/never_used_a_rolling_release_distribution/">this one</a> to be precise.</p>

<p>On that thread I got some good people on both sides of the fence. Some said they run Manjaro as their daily driver and some said they used it mostly in a secondary machine.</p>

<p>After that thread I decided to install Manjaro on my laptop. I normally donâ€™t use my laptop to work from 9 to 5. But I have all the tools installed on it if I need that for some reason. I also use it for browsing, answering some emails and Iâ€™m writing this post on it right now (already on Manjaro).</p>

<p>My main concern was always stability, I always felt like Arch was mostly the beta testers in Linux, always living on the most recent software. However I found out that Manjaro even though its based on Arch, it doesnâ€™t have the same release cycle.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s actually happening:</p>

<p>My plan is to open my laptop everyday, update the system everytime thereâ€™s updates and see if during that month everything stays normal. After that month Iâ€™ll see if I like it better than the Debian based distros Iâ€™ve been using and see if I change or not.</p>
