I"±<p>Yes, lately Iâ€™ve been doing some Wordpress stuff. Before you start throwing stones, Iâ€™m not doing the kind of stuff to be ashamed about. Iâ€™m actually building some blogs.</p>

<p>One thing that bothers me a lot is the admin bar on the front-end, always there, always present. Fucking up my css.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I looked around a little bit and I found this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>	add_filter('show_admin_bar', '__return_false');
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Just shove that in your wp-config.php file and youâ€™ll be good to go.</p>

<p>&lt; sarcasm &gt;How awesome is wordpress right?&lt;/ sarcasm &gt;</p>
