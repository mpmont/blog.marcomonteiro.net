<p>One of the best things about using Codeigniter is obviously the community and how easy it is to find solutions to your problems. You have a lot of options, the IRC channel, the forums, the awesome documentation and you had the wiki.</p>

<p>Well codeigniter moved all the code from bitbucket to github and that was awesome. However, ElisLab always had their own wiki. People used it a lot, adding libraries, helpers and some good advices on how to do stuff with the framework. The sky was the limit and there was no disturbance in the force.

Somehow ElisLab decided that it would be great to have everything on github, since every repo can have their own wiki so why not move the wiki to the repository? Sounded like a great thing to do.</p>

<p>So they did it, they moved everything to github and there was a disturbance in the force. They forgot to update all the links, move all the attachements and so forth.</p>

<p>Result: nothing works.</p>

<p>I rarely use the wiki, however, from time to time google sent me there and I was happy about that. Now we donâ€™t have that option anymore and God how annoying it is to click on a link on google thinking that you have the solution to your problems only to see that link is going nowhere.</p>
