<p>Just dropping by to tell you that I moved my blog from a self hosted wordpress blog to a tumblr blog. And now Iâ€™m using a sub-domain for my blog.</p>

<p>The main reason behing this decision was just the fact that I was not happy with my hosting and therefore Iâ€™m moving all my stuff away from them.</p>

<p>Tumblr looks like a good free option to me.</p>

<p>ps: Iâ€™m sorry if all the feed are going crazy and they apear all marked as unread. Thatâ€™s because all the posts have a new link now, thereâ€™s no need to update your feed though.</p>
