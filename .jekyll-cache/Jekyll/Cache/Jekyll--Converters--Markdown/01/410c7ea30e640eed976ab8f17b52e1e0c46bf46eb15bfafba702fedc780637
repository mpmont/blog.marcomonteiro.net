<p>Lately I picked up on this thing called Yoda Conditions. I started using this on a new project Iâ€™ve been working on. First it was a bit odd I must say, but once I got into it boy do I love to declare my conditions like this.</p>

<p>The big upside from this is that when youâ€™re reading the code you actually see the expected result first. You can actually see that on the image example.</p>

<p>The term â€œYoda Conditionsâ€ was coined by <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/251153/zneak">zneak</a> a stackoverflow user.</p>
