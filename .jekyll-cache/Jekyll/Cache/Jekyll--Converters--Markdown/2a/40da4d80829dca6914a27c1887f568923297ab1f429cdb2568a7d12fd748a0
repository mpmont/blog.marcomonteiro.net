I"Ä<p>Last weekend we had our anual christmas party at the office. Until now I was only used to those small Christmas parties. I only worked for small companies and even when I didnâ€™t, normally they did the parties by team and not has a whole company.</p>

<p>I was really excited about the party, on one hand I would get to be with everyone in one place, which only happens twice a year (we also have a summer party). On the other hand thereâ€™s always a open bar.</p>

<p>Since it was my first time at this, I was everything but ready for what was about to happen. Every year the company rewards a few people on different categories. You know, like the Oscars, but instead of getting a gold statue you get a Teddy Bear (from the movie Monsters, Inc.) and thereâ€™s no nominees, hence you always have those unexpected winners.</p>

<p>Well, guess what? I was one of those cases. Well at least I think I was. Some may think I wasnâ€™t. Some were actually expecting it. What matters is that I wasnâ€™t, at all.</p>

<p>Apparently everyone on my team (or almost everyone) already knew that I was going to win (I know right? Bunch of assholes).</p>

<p>The award I won was the â€œrevelation awardâ€. It means that I (allegedly) stood out somehow. Itâ€™s good to know that the company is appreciating my work. But I wouldnâ€™t be doing my work if it wasnâ€™t for this people.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s right, this is the team I work with, and since I work with them everyday, I think itâ€™s safe to say that this award was only a product of a team effort.</p>

<p>I know my acceptance speech wasnâ€™t perfect, basically it went like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thank you!

</blockquote>

<p>I donâ€™t even know what that means in binary, but I thought it was funny at the time. It wasnâ€™t, I was just drunk.</p>

<p>Now that I put some thought into it (and Iâ€™m not drunk) I can say this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thank you Grupo CH (the company). Itâ€™s been a great year working with you. I want to thank my team, not just for their everyday work, but specially for being more than just co-workers. Youâ€™re all friends of mine and Iâ€™m a better person because I had the pleasure to meet you.</p>
