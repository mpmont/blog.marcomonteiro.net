<p>Are you? If you are, this might interest you. I‚Äôve been doing some consultant work where I‚Äôm basically putting Intranets to the test. Basically I‚Äôm the troll telling people what are they doing right or wrong.</p>

<p>So his is what I‚Äôve found so far on things that you might want to avoid.</p>

<!--more-->

<p><strong><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Unclear intranet ownership and governance</strong></p>

<p>The problem here normally resides with the the people that define the user privilegies. Normally they either have more people than they should with ‚Äú<em>admin</em>‚Äù privileges, or they have just one person. Both are normally wrong. You should make clear choices on who takes care of what. But more importantly, the people using it should know who‚Äôs in charge of what.</p>

<p><strong><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Designing by opinion</strong></p>

<p>This is the most common mistake. The people designing the Intranet, do it by what they think is right, but they don‚Äôt do any background work to support those decisions. This will bit you in the ass sooner than later.</p>

<p><strong><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Designing only half of the intranet</strong></p>

<p>Again, a major design problem. The guys in charge of the design think:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It‚Äôs a Intranet, only the company will see this and the world is not going to care about it. So I‚Äôm just going to design a couple of pages and define some guidelines and it will be ok.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It‚Äôs not! If people are using something you‚Äôre designing then you should make an effort to do a good job. Not just because it‚Äôs your job, but because people are going to care about your product. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs 3 or 1000 users. If your work affect just one person, you should do a good job. This is a fact for everything not just design.</p>

<p><strong><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Taking the publisher‚Äôs perspective</strong></p>

<p>The guys building the Intranet take the publisher perspective disregarding the users perspective completely. This happens not only on Intranet projects but on most big web projects.</p>

<p><strong><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Allowing technology to rule the design</strong></p>

<p>This is a common one when it comes to Intranets. Normally Intranets aren‚Äôt built from scratch. And that‚Äôs ok. But the technology that you chose shouldn‚Äôt dictate what can and cannot be done by your users or publishers.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve found many more throughout my consultant experience. But these one were the ones that I found more often. I hope this helps you in the future when you have to build or work on a Intranet project.</p>
