<p>I just did a fresh install of vagrant and built it using the online tool from PuPHPet. Had everything ready but I wasn‚Äôt able to connect to my mysql server.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The problem was in my SSH password. I thought it was this one:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>u. vagrant
p. vagrant
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But for some reason it wasn‚Äôt (yes it was left it as the default one from PuPHPet). So for consistency now everytime I do a fresh install I  always do a few things; Access my machine via SSH.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    $ vagrant ssh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Changing the way your server deals with mysql connections.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    $ sudo nano /etc/mysql/my.cnf   
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here you want to find the bindaddress setting which will be set to 127.0.0.0 and change it to 0.0.0.0. Don‚Äôt forget to restart the mysql server after this.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    $ sudo service mysql restart
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Anythins left to do is change your password to ‚Äúvagrant‚Äù for consistency.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    $ passwd
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That‚Äôs it, now you can connect without any problems via SSH tunnel to your mysql.</p>
