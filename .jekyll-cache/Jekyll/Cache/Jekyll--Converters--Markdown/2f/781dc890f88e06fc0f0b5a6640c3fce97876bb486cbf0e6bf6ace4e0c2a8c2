I"2<p>From time to time, I have to work on a really crappy server. They have the weirdest rules of all, they’re obssed with security. I don’t have a right to see logs, they randomly block my IP from time to time. I can’t even call <a href="http://pt1.php.net/phpinfo">phpinfo()</a>. Yeah, that bad!</p>
