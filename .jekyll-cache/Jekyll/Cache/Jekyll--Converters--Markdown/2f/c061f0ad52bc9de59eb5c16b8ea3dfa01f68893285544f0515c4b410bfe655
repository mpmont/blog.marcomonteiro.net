I"Å<p>PuPHPet is a simple GUI to set up virtual machines for PHP development.</p>

<p>This is a gui configurator for the <a href="http://vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> automation tool. It uses <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">Puppet</a> as the provisioning backend.
This is similar to another tool that recently came out, <a href="http://rove.io/">Rove.io</a>, although that one is more focused on using Vagrant with Chef, and has different configuration options.</p>
