<p>Well since Iâ€™m now working as a freelancer I now have a bit more power over what framework should be used for this or that project. Therefore, I think Iâ€™m not going to use Codeigniter by choice anymore. This means Iâ€™ll use it if the client requests it. Or if by any chance Iâ€™m working with someone else that is only familiar with CI and not Laravel.

Also I still need to support a lot of applications that were built with CI, and since the code doenâ€™t re-write itself Iâ€™m going to continue with Codeigniter on those.</p>
