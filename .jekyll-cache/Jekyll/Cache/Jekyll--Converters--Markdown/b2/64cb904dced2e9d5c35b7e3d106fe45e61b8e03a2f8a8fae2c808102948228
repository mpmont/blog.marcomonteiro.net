I"¯<p>Ever since <a href="http://blog.marcomonteiro.net/post/a-message-from-the-future">I stopped using normal RSS clients</a> I started using apps like <a href="https://flipboard.com/">Flipboard</a> to read my content. Since then, I notice that some content coming from some sources would look amazing, and some would look awful. So Iâ€™ve done some research and noticed that you can improve how your content looks on flipboard.</p>
