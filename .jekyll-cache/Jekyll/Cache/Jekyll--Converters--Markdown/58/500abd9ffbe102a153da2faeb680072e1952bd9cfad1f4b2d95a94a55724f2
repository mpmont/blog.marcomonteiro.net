I"X<p>Last week I installed Manjaro Linux on my laptop and since then I’ve been using it as I would my work machine, even though I still use my desktop as my primary machine.</p>

<!--more -->

<p>I made my USB stick and went with the KDE version of Manjaro. The installation worked like a charm, even the live USB worked incredible.</p>

<p>Even thought I had my computer configured with my /home in another partition I decided to do a clean install and just format my home directory since if I end up installing it on my Desktop that’s what I’ll do.</p>

<p>After the install I updated the system, but a new version of Manjaro just came out, so I zero updates to do. I was not expeting that.</p>

<p>Then I started to tweak the KDE settings and most of all the “add/remove software” app, where you can configure how you wan your package manager to work.</p>

<p>I decided to enable pacman, AUR, flatpak and appImages.</p>

<p>Just a few momments later I started to install my software and adding my dotfiles from github.</p>

<p>First of all I was quite impressed with te amount of software available on pacman and AUR. I didn’t have to add any sources like ppa on debian. Everything was avaiable and I could install it with one click or via terminal.</p>

<p>One basic example is docker and docker compose. Tools that I use everyday at work and at home. On debian based distros I had to read one or two pages of documentation to get them installed and working. On Manjaro?</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sudo pacman -S docker docker-compose
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s it!</p>

<p>So far first impressions are looking really good. I’m impressed with the package manager, the speed of everything, even the KDE theme is impressive.</p>

<p>Let’s see how it goes next week.</p>
