<p>The idea behind the group is for project representatives to talk about the commonalities between our projects and find ways we can work together. Our main audience is each other, but weâ€™re very aware that the rest of the PHP community is watching. If other folks want to adopt what weâ€™re doing they are welcome to do so, but that is not the aim.
