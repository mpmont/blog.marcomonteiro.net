I"P<p>Mike Monteiro is a Portuguese/American designer, one of the founders of <a href="http://muledesign.com/">Mule Design</a>. Heâ€™s probably my favorite speaker when it comes to the subject of Design. He wrote one book called <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/design-is-a-job">Design is a Job</a> that I highly recommend.</p>
