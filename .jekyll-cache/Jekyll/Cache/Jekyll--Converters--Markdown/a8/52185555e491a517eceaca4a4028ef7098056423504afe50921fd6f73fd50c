I"à<p>Oh my, did you noticed that Laracon is right around the corner? Thatâ€™s right, next week Iâ€™ll be traveling to Amsterdam for a small geek gathering.</p>

<p>I look forward to check out the city, thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m going to stay there for a couple extra days. Also Iâ€™ll be with some of the people that went with me to Ciconf last year. But, most of all I canâ€™t wait to met new people. People that I talk almost every week on twitter or IRC and the ones that I donâ€™t even know about.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s always that awkward feeling when you put a face on a avatar. But you know what the best part is? Going to conferences like this one, even if youâ€™re a guru that wrongly thinks that has nothing to learn, you always do.</p>

<p>I look forward to learn with you.</p>
