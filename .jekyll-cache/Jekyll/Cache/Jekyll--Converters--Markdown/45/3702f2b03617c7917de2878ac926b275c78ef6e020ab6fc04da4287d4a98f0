I"è<p>Well i‚Äôm a webdeveloper, therefore much of my work is making an idea come to reality, or making the website ‚Äúalive‚Äù. That can be achieved with css among other things. This is my favorite thing to do on my daily work, styling a website. With this article i‚Äôll be trying to show my process of doing this.</p>

<p>First of all i try to use only one css file, but sometimes the file get‚Äôs so big that you might find useful to make some divisions. So, if you can‚Äôt use only one file try not to use more than 3, after that you will see the difference specially when someone is arriving to the website for the first time.

Using only one file i would say that there‚Äôs no perfect way of coding, but still i‚Äôll give it a go and show you mine.</p>

<p>First bit of code:
One thing that most developers tend to forget is the credits, hell if you have the hard work of making the code, and if in the end you are proud of what you done so why not put a little signature? This is my signature on every project i‚Äôve worked so far:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>/*
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Project name: here goes your project name
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Copyright information:
# Copyright (C) 2008-2009 ( company name ) All Rights Reserved.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Project information:
# version: 0.0.0 (00/00/0000)
# Tested in: Firefox; Chrome; Opera; Safari; IE8; IE7;
# (this CSS will not be optimized for IE6 or any other before that)

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let me explain why all of this is very important. The project name is self explanatory, you always want your projects to have a name. The copyright information is also very important, and always be very careful with this. Your client may not like what you put there if is not completely true.</p>

<p>Next we have the project information, this is not only for other developers in case someone will be picking up where you left but also to keep track of your work. Always keep the version field up to date among with the date field. The ‚Äútested in‚Äù field is also important in case someone try to debug your code. One more thing, stop developing for IE6 at all cost, always try to explain to your client that you will probably need more time to debug the website for it to work in IE6 than making some cool features for the website.</p>

<p>And the last one but not the least, your information!
So, now you can see how this is a big deal, first you want to speed the word about your work, then if you are a webdeveloper like me you find yourself sometimes snooping around other peeps code, and sometimes you even want to contact the team that put all the work together but some other times you want to contact just the guy that made a portion of the job. That is why you should always do this, so get your own signature or use this one.</p>

<p>The next step is to pick a good reset styles, this is very important and some developers tend to forget this, without this you will be having a lot more problems with different browsers and a bunch of other problems like strange margins or paddings that wasn‚Äôt suppose to be there in the first place.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>/* --------------------------------------------------------------
reset.css
* Resets default browser CSS.
-------------------------------------------------------------- */
html, body, div, span, object, iframe,
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, blockquote, pre,
a, abbr, acronym, address, code,
del, dfn, em, img, q, dl, dt, dd, ol, ul, li,
fieldset, form, label, legend,
table, caption, tbody, tfoot, thead, tr, th, td {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  border: 0;
  font-weight: inherit;
  font-style: inherit;
  font-size: 100%;
  font-family: inherit;
  vertical-align: baseline;
}
em {
	font-style: italic;
}

table {
	border-collapse: separate; border-spacing: 0;
}

caption, th, td {
	text-align: left; font-weight: normal;
}

table, td, th {
	vertical-align: middle;
}

blockquote:before, blockquote:after, q:before, q:after {
	content: ‚Äú‚Äù;
}

blockquote, q {
	quotes: ‚Äù‚Äù ‚Äú‚Äù;
}

a img {
	border: none;
}

html, body{
	margin:0;
	padding:0;
	text-align:center;
	background: none;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is the one i use, but there‚Äôs much more you just need to google it for a bit, the last one that i‚Äôve seen and that caught my attention was this one: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/reset/</p>

<p>So this is the first part of my way of styling and the thing you have to retain on this one is: always put your signature on your work, and use a good ‚Äúreset styles‚Äù so you don‚Äôt get in trouble in the near future.</p>

<p>Next week i‚Äôll be covering on how to divide your file and and some rules that i always apply when i‚Äôm styling some markup.</p>
