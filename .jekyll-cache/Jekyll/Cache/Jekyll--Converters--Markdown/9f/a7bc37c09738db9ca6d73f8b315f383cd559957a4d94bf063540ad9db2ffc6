<p>Iâ€™m a big git flow fan, no doubt about that. I use it every day and I still think that it is the perfect way to work with a team of people. But, from time to time, you find yourself working on a small project. One that youâ€™re just going to hack during the weekend and you want something simpler.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.git-legit.org/">Legit</a> (Git workflow for humans) got you covered.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Basically it works like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git sync
# Synchronizes current branch. Auto-merge/rebase, un/stash.

$ git switch &lt;branch&gt;
# Switches to branch. Stashes and restores unstaged changes.

$ git publish &lt;branch&gt;
# Publishes branch to remote server.

$ git unpublish &lt;branch&gt;
# Removes branch from remote server.

$ git branches
# Nice &amp; pretty list of branches + publication status.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>See how easy it to work with a feature branch?</p>

<p>Now letâ€™s say you want to install it and start using it, if you use <a href="http://brew.sh/">homebrew</a> like myself then once again I got you covered.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ brew install legit
To enable the git aliases:

$ legit install
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Nice and simple â€” the way it should be.</p>
