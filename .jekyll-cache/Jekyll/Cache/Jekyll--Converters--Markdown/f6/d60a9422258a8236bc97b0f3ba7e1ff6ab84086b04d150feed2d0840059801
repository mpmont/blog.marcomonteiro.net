I"*<p>Just dropping by to tell you that I moved my blog from a self hosted wordpress blog to a tumblr blog. And now I’m using a sub-domain for my blog.</p>

<p>The main reason behing this decision was just the fact that I was not happy with my hosting and therefore I’m moving all my stuff away from them.</p>

<p>Tumblr looks like a good free option to me.</p>

<p>ps: I’m sorry if all the feed are going crazy and they apear all marked as unread. That’s because all the posts have a new link now, there’s no need to update your feed though.</p>
