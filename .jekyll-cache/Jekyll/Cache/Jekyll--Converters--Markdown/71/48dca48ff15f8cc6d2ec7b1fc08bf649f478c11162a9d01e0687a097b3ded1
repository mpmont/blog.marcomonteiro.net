<p>A month ago I was chitchatting with the awesome people from the Internet (I was on IRC) and I got a private message a guy that I know from there from a long time. He wanted to ask me what I thought about a project that he was starting with some friends. The project was called Lunk.</p>

<!--more-->

<p><strong>So why am I making a post about a project that is not even mine?</strong></p>

<p>Because I think this is a one of a kind project, since I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s anything like it out there.</p>

<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>

<p>Itâ€™s quite simple actually. Itâ€™s a service to share information (text, code, file(s)) with someone. Youâ€™re probably thinking now that thereâ€™s a lot of services that work like that, but this one does one thing that others donâ€™t.</p>

<p>Remember the guy from the image? Itâ€™s just like that. Your message can only be seen one time by the person you shared the link with.
This is specially useful if youâ€™re sharing sensible information like a API key or a password. A feature like this will prevent the person you sent the Lunk to re-share the info, and you can manage your Lunkâ€™s and see which one was opened / destroyed and the ones that havenâ€™t been opened yet.</p>

<p><strong>Since this is a service that work with sensitive information security is very important. Just look at the main features:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>SSL encryption is forced on site.</li>
  <li>Lunks are only viewable once, so you donâ€™t have to worry about information sent being viewed later if the link gets out.</li>
  <li>Passwords are optional (paid users), for additional piece of mind.</li>
  <li>Full encryption is available (Lunk a Lot users).</li>
  <li>Syntax highlighting is available on common languages (a lot more coming soon).</li>
  <li>See if Lunks have been viewed, for verification of delivery. For paid users, number of failed attempts, and detailed view history.</li>
  <li>Customized view limitations, such as viewable more than once, viewable custom amount of time (coming soon).</li>
  <li>API for integration other than web browser (such as browser extentions, or OS integration (files)). In development.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another thing that you might be afraid about a service like this is their privacy policies, well you shouldnâ€™t. Just look at their privacy Policy.</p>

<p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>

<p>We donâ€™t sell your information.â€œ</p>

<p>As you can see on the 3rd feature I mentioned, Lunk has some paid features divided by 3 plans. Free / Lunk a little / Lunk a lot.</p>

<p>So if you like the concept (who am I kidding you love it) just try it out or give feedback you can do it just now.</p>
