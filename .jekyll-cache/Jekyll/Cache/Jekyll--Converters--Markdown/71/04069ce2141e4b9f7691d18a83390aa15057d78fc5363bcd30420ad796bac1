<p>Apparently Facebook has a new pet. Itâ€™s called <em>The Internet</em>. The project has actually some good points.</p>

<p>Internet.org is a global partnership between technology leaders, nonprofits, local communities and experts who are working together to bring the internet to the two thirds of the worldâ€™s population that doesnâ€™t have it.</p>

<p>It all sounds really good. Untilâ€¦</p>

<center><small>You can see the video <strong>[here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdWaZkvAJfM)</strong></small></center>

<p>I saw their video campaign, and that got me a bit mad. Call me closed minded or even lunatic, I donâ€™t care. But that video showed the armpits of the world. I know theyâ€™re trying to do a good thing. But shouldnâ€™t we be more worried about getting food orâ€¦ I donâ€™t know: electricity and drinkable water instead of lolcats?</p>

<p>I know the Internet is way more than lolcats, thereâ€™s also porn.</p>

<p>We know for a fact that this is true:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œThe internet boosts economic, social and political development, and contributes to the progress of humankind as a whole.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><span style="text-align: right;"><small>â€”United Nations Human Rights Council report</small></span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>All Iâ€™m saying is that this is a good thing, but maybe we ought focus on more important things.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œMaking the internet available to every person on earth is a goal too large and too important for any one company, group, or government to solve alone. Internet.orgâ€™s partners have come together to meet this challenge because they believe in the power of a connected world.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another great point, but I think I can see whoâ€™s going to benefit from this first. Letâ€™s just take a look at the partners.</p>

<ul>
  <li><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Ericsson</li>
  <li><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Mediatek</li>
  <li><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Opera Software</li>
  <li><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Samsung</li>
  <li><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> facebook</li>
  <li><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Nokia</li>
  <li><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Qualcomm</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, donâ€™t take this the wrong way. Again, I think this is a good thing, butâ€¦ priorities.</p>
