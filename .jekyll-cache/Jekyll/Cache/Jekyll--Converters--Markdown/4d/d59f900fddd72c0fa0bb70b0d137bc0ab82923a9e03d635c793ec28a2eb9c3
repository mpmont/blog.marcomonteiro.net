<p>My fellow readers, you probably didn’t noticed but I’ve been off the grid for the last 2 or 3 weeks. I had a minor problem with my knee. My real knee, not my skyrim knee. Therefore, I wasn’t able to blog much for the past weeks. Or even try new things to blog about.</p>

<p>Ironically I made a new skyrim character during the past two weeks and I played a lot of xbox. But hey, I’m back to business now and it’s time to start over.</p>

<p>I’m planing a screencast series and I also have a few articles lined up. I’m excited about it. What about you?</p>

<p>I hope you’re still on the other side of the Interwebs waiting for my dumps of information.</p>
