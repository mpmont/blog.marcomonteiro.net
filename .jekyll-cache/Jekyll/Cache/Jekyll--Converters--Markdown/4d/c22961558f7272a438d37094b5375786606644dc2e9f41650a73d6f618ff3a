I"X<p>Let’s be clear, I’m still using OSX at work, mostly because there’s no need to change there these days. The computer is already there, so why change?</p>

<p>For the past 8 or 9 years I’ve been using as my main computer a macbookpro. First gen I bought was awesome, lasted for years. Upgraded it with some more RAM, and then I even removed the DVD player (remember those?) and shoved a SSD and the computer was great.</p>

<p>Then I decided to sell it and bought one of the new ones. One of those that you can’t really do anything to it (hardware wise). After some thought I decided it was time to make a decision, and believe it or not it all started with me selling my PS4. Sold it and decided to make a gamming rig. Then I also sold my new macbookpro and I was like  “-Man, I could make a hackingtosh!” So I made my gamming rig with all compatible parts and build it like that.</p>

<p>Bought a second SSD so I could have really separate environments, windows and OSX. Problem was, when I started fidling with the hackingtosh I got bored with it very fast.</p>

<p>Next logical step? I gave Ubuntu 17.10 a go and man was I impressed, everything is so fucking awesome with it. Works so well, they removed Unity that I always hated and got back to gnome 3.</p>

<p>My environment now is basically one hardrive with Linux and one with Windows 10 (that I actually kinda like too).</p>

<p>People, do you a favor if you’re a developer start looking at other alternatives, because windows 10 and Linux really are these days.</p>

<p>I’ll be posting more details about my environment soon.</p>
