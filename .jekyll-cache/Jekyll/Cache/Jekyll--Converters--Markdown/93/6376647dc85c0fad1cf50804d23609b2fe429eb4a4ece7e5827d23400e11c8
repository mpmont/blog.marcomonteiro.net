I"É<p>On the second part of the first day, Jordi Boggiano took the stage. Jordi is a lead developer of Composer, the PHP dependency manager that has taken the PHP world by storm.</p>

<p><strong>In-Depth with Composer</strong> was the name of his talk.</p>

<p>So as expected his talk was all about composer. As you can see in his talk <a href="http://joind.in/9028">here</a> it was mostly about tricks and tips about it.</p>

<p>One of the best quotes so far from his talk was probably this one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Itâ€™s cool to be bleeding edge, but itâ€™s bleeding for a reason.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I couldnâ€™t agree more. People should be careful while using beeding edge tecnology. Specially with composer packages.</p>
