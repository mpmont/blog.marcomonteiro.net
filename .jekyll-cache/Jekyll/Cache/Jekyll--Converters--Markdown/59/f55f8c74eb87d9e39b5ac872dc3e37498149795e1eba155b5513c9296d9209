I"ö<p>For the past weeks Iâ€™ve been reading some material about a lot of subjects on the web like SEO, Responsive Webdesign, SocialMedia and whatever piece of information I can get my hands on that can give a bit more know how about every aspects of the web. And last month I had a two weeks vacation (check the link to see everything Iâ€™ve accomplished from my todo list) I had some more time for the reading department. During that time Iâ€™ve come across with this book by Marc-AndrÃ© Cournoyer.</p>
