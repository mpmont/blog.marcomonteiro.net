I"<p>I’m a CodeIgniter lover, user and abuser. This is how I normally describe myself when I have to tell someone something about one of the greatest tools I’ve worked so far in webdevelopment and what I do with it. By now, if you worked with me at some point you know that I use CodeIgniter almost every day and I never get bored with it. And I hope to make you at the very least try it, if not, at least try to insight you in why I’m using it.
