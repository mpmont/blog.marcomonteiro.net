<p>One of the things that was really annoying me at work was that some of the people there was still 1995 and coding in a team without using any kind of version control.</p>

<p>Well not anymore. We had a couple of big projects coming in, and finally I convinced all the people there that we really needed to get everyone to use Git or Mercurial. So I explained the concepts then we created a small dummy repository and started playing around with it. After a little while everyone was discovering the power of being in 2012.

Ok thereâ€™s still a lot to do, they still have some bad habits from using errr nothing, like working for a day without committing anything to the repository. But I think that will end with time.</p>

<p>What can I ask next? Well the only thing Iâ€™d like to happen next would be for us to start using real hosting companies and not 1975 companies or whatever company our client had a contract with. If that happens in the near future Iâ€™ll be one hell of a happy nerd.</p>

<p>Oh well, one canâ€™t ask for everything at once can we? :)</p>

<p>If you having the same problem I had you might want to reason with your team and try to get them to the dark side.</p>

<p>Also show them <a href="http://thinkvitamin.com/design/git-for-designers-part-1/%3Cbr/%3Ehttp://thinkvitamin.com/design/git-for-designers-part-1/%3Cbr/%3Ehttp://thinkvitamin.com/design/git-for-designers-part-1/">this tutorial</a> so they can see that is not so hard to do.</p>

<p>And finally it you have any problems convincing your team I think in that article just this part should be enough for that. If not, I think you have a bigger problem in your hands.</p>

<p><strong>Why Use Version Control?</strong></p>

<p>You might be wondering why you should use version control, even for a site youâ€™ll never collaborate with anyone on. This is a valid question. I can best illustrate the answer with a scenario you may have encountered in the past. Letâ€™s say youâ€™re in the middle of making a site and want to try something crazy with the css. Maybe you want to do a bit of an experiment and make everything strange shades of yellow and red. You donâ€™t know if youâ€™re going to keep the work when you finish it. Since itâ€™s an experiment, it would probably be a good idea to not mess up your working version of the site.</p>

<p>At this point, you might be thinking of creating a copy of the site and making your changes on the copy. Maybe youâ€™re sure that youâ€™re going to use this work and youâ€™re going to crank through. Maybe it doesnâ€™t work out, though. Wouldnâ€™t it be nice if you could take a snapshot of your site now, do your experiment, and not have to worry about whether you mess things up? Thatâ€™s exactly what version control is for!</p>
