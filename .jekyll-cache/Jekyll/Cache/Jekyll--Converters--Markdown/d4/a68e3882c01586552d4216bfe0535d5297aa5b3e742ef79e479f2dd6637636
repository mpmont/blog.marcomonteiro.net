<p>Well since Iâ€™m now working as a freelancer I now have a bit more power over what framework should be used for this or that project. Therefore, I think Iâ€™m not going to use Codeigniter by choice anymore. This means Iâ€™ll use it if the client requests it. Or if by any chance Iâ€™m working with someone else that is only familiar with CI and not Laravel.

Also I still need to support a lot of applications that were built with CI, and since the code doenâ€™t re-write itself Iâ€™m going to continue with Codeigniter on those.</p>

<p>I might even chose Codeigniter if somehow I get a long term project that needs support for a long time. Because like I said on other posts, Codeigniter is amazing for that.</p>

<p>Now, when weâ€™re talking about projects that will not last longer in terms of support Iâ€™m going to use Laravel.</p>

<p>For now Iâ€™m still not confortable about using Laravel 4 in production. But I feel quite confortable using Laravel 3, specially when they told me on #laravel@freenode that Laravel 3 will be supported even after Laravel 4 comes out. This is great news, because what it means is that Laravel 3 will be some kind of LTS (Long Term Support) version of Laravel. Getting all of those sweet security updates and whatnot.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I donâ€™t want people from the CI community to think that Iâ€™m out for good. Iâ€™m not, but Iâ€™m probably not going to be that active as I used to be there.</p>

<p>Ps: All the codeigniter projects that Iâ€™m involved with will continue being supported. Like my helpers and the snippets package for sublime text.</p>
