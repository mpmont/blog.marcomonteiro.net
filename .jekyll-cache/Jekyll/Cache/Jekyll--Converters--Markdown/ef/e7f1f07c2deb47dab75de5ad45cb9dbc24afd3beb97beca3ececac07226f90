I"’<p>You may or may not know, but last month I went to Amsterdam for <a href="http://laracon.eu/2013/">Laracon EU</a>. I wrote a few posts about it. At the time they promised that everything would be recorded so all the devs out there could see it. They promised and theyâ€™re now delivering. For now we access to 5 videos, but soon there will be more. Just keep track of Laracon EU youtube channel.</p>
