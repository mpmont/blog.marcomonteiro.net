I"É<p>For the past weeks Iâ€™ve been reading some material about a lot of subjects on the web like SEO, Responsive Webdesign, SocialMedia and whatever piece of information I can get my hands on that can give a bit more know how about every aspects of the web. And last month I had a two weeks vacation (check the link to see everything Iâ€™ve accomplished from my todo list) I had some more time for the reading department. During that time Iâ€™ve come across with this book by Marc-AndrÃ© Cournoyer.</p>

<p>Now if youâ€™re familiar with Marc-AndrÃ© work youâ€™ll know before hand that this will be a nice reading. Even before you actually do some reading. Yes, heâ€™s that awesome.

So whatâ€™s the book about?
Obviously Iâ€™m not giving you all the aspects of the book, you have to do the reading yourself. But I can leave you with some topics to spice things up a bit.</p>

<p>The eight principles of persuasion
This is the main topic of the book, every topic is well explained, therefore easy to understand. But the best thing about it is that Marc-AndrÃ© uses real examples on how to do it and how not to do it. Itâ€™s amazing.</p>

<p>The secret of copywriting
This is actual just some final thoughts on the book.</p>

<p>The A/B testing
Some people are against this method some people love it. I love it, and I think it just works. And if you are against it you are just afraid of the outcome. Marc-AndrÃ© has a really good position about A/B testing.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I think this book is really good, you can go by all of itâ€™s content in one hour and Iâ€™m sure in the end youâ€™ll see that it was time well spent.</p>
