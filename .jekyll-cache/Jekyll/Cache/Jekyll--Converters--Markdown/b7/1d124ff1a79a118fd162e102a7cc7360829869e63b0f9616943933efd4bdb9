<p>A few weeks ago I came across a problem that I haven‚Äôt had to deal with before. I was visiting a website on my computer, everything was normal. I could see all the information. That was exactly what I was expecting. Later that evening I wanted to show that website to a friend, but I was on my phone. When I got to the website on my phone I got this big message saying the website was not avaiable on my phone. As in, sure they didn‚Äôt bother to make a mobile version of the website and that‚Äôs ok. Instead they used the time they should be using to make a mobile version of that website to actually block all the users using smaller screens.</p>

<p>Seriously, just show me website in plain text. I wouldn‚Äôt mind that, really. Imagine my frustration if I happen to need your contacts. I pick up my phone, go to your website, and just got a message saying that</p>
