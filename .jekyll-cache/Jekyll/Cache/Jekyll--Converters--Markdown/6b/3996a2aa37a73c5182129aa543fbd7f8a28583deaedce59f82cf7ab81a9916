I"û<p>I was a hardcore online gamer for a while. Specially when I was in college (we all know how that is). However since I switched from Windows to OSX I stopped doing that. So I bought a xbox360 and now I do 90% of my gaming there. Even if I have some cool online games on Xbox I miss two types of games: Poker online and MMORPGâ€™s.</p>

<p>The first one I resolved it very quickly, found <a href="http://www.partypoker.com/">partypoker</a> since it was one of the few that actually had a pkg for a OSX app (most of the ones I found didnâ€™t) and the payment system works quite well.</p>

<p>Now the second part was not easy at all. First I found wurmonline but the java application was always crashing on mac. Then I tried Dungeon Hunter Alliance (bought it on the mac app store) and it is quite good.</p>

<p>So I think now Iâ€™m happy on my gaming thing. I have skyrim on my xbox, Party Poker to spend (or make) some money, and Dungeon Hunter Alliance to just hanging around and talk to some peeps.</p>
