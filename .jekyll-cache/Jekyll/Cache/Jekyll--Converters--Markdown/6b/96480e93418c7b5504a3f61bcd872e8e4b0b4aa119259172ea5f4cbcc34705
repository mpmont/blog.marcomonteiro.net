I"·<p>For the last 6 months or so I made it my mission to improve my privacy on the web. This article shows you what changes I made so far and what you can also do to protect yourself.</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 22px;"><strong><u> Stop using google.com</u></strong></h3>

<p>One of the first changed I made was stop myself from using google.com. Google tracks everything you do on the web, all your searchs, but most of all, instead of giving you the results that are more relevant based on their SEO score, they give you the result that they think are best for you. This keeps you from seeing different ideas or even getting into websites that might make more sense to what you look for.</p>

<p>I started using DuckDuckGo instead. They donâ€™t track your searches, and most of all you get unbiased results outside the Filter Bubble. They are committed to unbiased search thatâ€™s never based on your search history.</p>
