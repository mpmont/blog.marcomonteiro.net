I"Ô<p>Over the weekend Iâ€™ve written a small helper since latterly almost all of my projects have to work with youtube or even with vimeo. This is a helper to work with Codeigniter obviously.</p>

<p>Has usual Iâ€™ll give you guys the link to github. If you have any suggestions or have any issues with it, just post it on github. Also youâ€™re free to fork it and add awesomeness to it.</p>
