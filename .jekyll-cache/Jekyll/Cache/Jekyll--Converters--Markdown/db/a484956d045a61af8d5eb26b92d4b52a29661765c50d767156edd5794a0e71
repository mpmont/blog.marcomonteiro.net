I"u<p>Last week I read one of those articles that you never want to read. Anthony Ferrara also known as <a href="http://twitter.com/ircmaxell">@ircmaxell</a> on twitter left the Internals project.</p>

<p>I got to say, I never participated on the Internals discussions, I actually don’t think I have the know-how to. So I preffer to leave that to the experts and not be the annoying noob in the room.</p>

<p>Anthony wrote a complete blog post explaining why he did what he did, and I got to say: after reading the post, I’m amazed by the time he did stay there.</p>

<p>So, if you’re a PHP developer go read his article and give him your support on twitter.</p>
