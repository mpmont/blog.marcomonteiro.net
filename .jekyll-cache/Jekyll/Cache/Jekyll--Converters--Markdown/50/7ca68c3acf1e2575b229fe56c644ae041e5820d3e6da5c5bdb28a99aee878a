I"ô<p>Elislab wanted to focus their development into the product that actually made them money. Nothing wrong about that. They started to look for a someone to take care of Codeigniter. The community started to panic. Months have passed and finally codeigniter has a new home.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT) in Vancouver, Canada is a highly regarded applied technology institute with 48,000 full and part-time students. Their impressive BCIT School of Computing and Academic Studies teaches CodeIgniter to 150 students a year. Now, they are its stewards.</p>

<p>This was a great announcement in my opinion. As soon as they started to move their stuff into the new repo, and even get a new website everyone got excited again. Things are starting to move again.</p>

<p>The CodeIgniter project has an interim council, to oversee the release of CodeIgniter 3 and to steer the framework to the next level.</p>

<ul>
  <li><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> <strong>Andreas Pfotenhauer</strong> - Although I never met him in real life I think of him as a wise friend from the #codeigniter freenode channel.</li>
  <li><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> <strong>Andrey Andreev</strong> - Our codeigniter hero, keep going buddy</li>
  <li><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> <strong>Ben Edmunds</strong> - Iâ€™ve been using his code for years, heâ€™s a great addition to the project</li>
  <li><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> <strong>David Wosnitza</strong> - Long term Codeigniter user and abuser like myself</li>
  <li><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> <strong>Jim Parry</strong> - Heâ€™s the one in charge now, good luck to you</li>
  <li><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> <strong>Lonnie Ezell</strong> - Another great addition to the project</li>
</ul>

<p>Iâ€™m happy that Pfotenhauer, Andrey, David, and Ben are on this. All stand up guys that have done a lot for the framework over the years either helping with the development or just helping or advising others on IRC.</p>
