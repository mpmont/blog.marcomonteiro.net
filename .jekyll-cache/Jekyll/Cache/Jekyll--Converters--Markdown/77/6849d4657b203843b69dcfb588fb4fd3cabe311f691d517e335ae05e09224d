I"»<p>For quite a while I must admit I been using this method to sync my files. This has been problematic, files not really syncing in real time can be a pain in the ass, sepecially when youâ€™re making changes on front-end and want to see those changes on the fly.</p>

<p>So, do yourself a favor and change to rsync. To do so, you just need to edit your vagrant file for something like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>config.vm.synced_folder "./", "/vagrant", type: "rsync",
    rsync__exclude: ".git/"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This way youâ€™re using rsync and youâ€™re excluding your git folder. You can add other folder there. Now, when you start your vagrant box you have to do this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ vagrant up
$ vagrant rsync-auto
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And your files will be synced automatically.</p>
