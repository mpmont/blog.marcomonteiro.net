I"±<p>Iâ€™ve been working in the creative business for a while now, and being around people that need to be creative for a living can have itâ€™s advantages, and disadvantages.</p>

<p>In one hand if you work with really good creatives you tend to be blown away by their ideas. On the other hand, you have to deal with the creative badges that they so proudly use. The â€œIâ€™m so damn busy badgeâ€.
<!--more-->
Or, the other good one called, â€œI have so much stuff to do!â€ badge.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a fact. Creative people - like designers and such - always like to brag about having so much stuff to do, and most of all saying that they donâ€™t even have time to sleep.</p>

<p><strong>So hereâ€™s my view on these so called badges.</strong></p>

<p>Creative folks, get your shit together, if you have too much stuff to do, or donâ€™t even have time to sleep that can only mean one of three things.</p>

<ul>
  <li><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Youâ€™re not productive.</li>
  <li><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> You donâ€™t know how to manage your own time.</li>
  <li><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> You donâ€™t know how to say the word no.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you work alone and suffer from one of these, I would say thatâ€™s ok. Itâ€™s your problem after all. However, when you work as a team, working with people that suffer from these diseases can be frustrating.</p>

<p>I think the second and the third are the main problems. The first one is actually more of an effect from those two. So letâ€™s review those.</p>

<p><strong>You donâ€™t know how to manage your own time</strong></p>

<p>My guess is that you normally donâ€™t divide your time in tasks. You donâ€™t know how much time youâ€™ll need to deliver a product, and the worst problem of it all, you donâ€™t respect deadlines.</p>

<p><strong>You donâ€™t know how to say no</strong></p>

<p>Hereâ€™s the thing, everyone has to say no some time. If you donâ€™t have time to do something get some help. Donâ€™t say that youâ€™ll going to deliver everything by yourself when you know you canâ€™t. Youâ€™ll end up making a lazy job or even worst not delivering at all.</p>

<p>People! Stop using these badges proudly. You should be ashamed if you use them.</p>
