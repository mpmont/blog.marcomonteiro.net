I"Ž<p>This week Gowalla released a new mobile app both for Android and IOS. When I heard this I was so excited. Iâ€™m not using gowalla for that long, I used foursquare when I started checkin into places. But lately I noticed that I had much more real friends on Gowalla than foursquare. So I changed to Gowalla and I love it.</p>

<p>I loved Gowala, itâ€™s was fun, fast and most of all it worked. Well not anymore, not after that last version. For what Iâ€™ve been reading they changed the business strategy, trying to difference their product from foursquare. I can relate to that, since thereâ€™s no space in the market for both. But I never thought they would go down this path.

<strong>First the website.</strong></p>

<p>My profile is now buggy, since the update I canâ€™t see my friends updates. And then my passport, canâ€™t find all the rewards Iâ€™ve found while using Gowala. But ok, no more of that, I can live with that. But the friends stream bug is sure is annoying.

It appears that Iâ€™m not alone, since thereâ€™s a lot more people with this problem. Try to contact Gowalla on twitter and this was their response.</p>

<p><strong>Now the app.</strong></p>

<p>The checkin process: (Looks like Gowalla is not about checkin anymore) now you have a division first the visited spots, than the near by spots. Thatâ€™s cool, I like it. Because if you have a routine is much easier if the spots you already entered are there for you to checkin. Thumbs up for that.</p>

<p>Than you select a spot and the first thing you have to do is enter the name of the user or person that is with you. Thatâ€™s cool too, still Iâ€™m not comfortable with this feature, since I couldnâ€™t find a place in my settings to say that I donâ€™t want other people to checkin for me in a place.</p>

<p>And thatâ€™s it, your checkin is done. No comments, nothing! Now you create a story. A story? Really? What is this? Alice in wonderland?</p>

<p>But now the part that I canâ€™t really understand is why is the share button only at the end of the process? Wouldnâ€™t it be easy to just have some kind of checkbox before to share the checkin?</p>

<p>But ok, fine. I still can live with that.</p>

<p>So, I click share at the end because sometimes I like to share this information on Twitter. Than you chose the platform (Facebook, Foursquare or Twitter) And you get the message â€¦Say something fabulousâ€œ. I thought: Ok, this will be the message to be displayed with my sharing. But no such luck.</p>

<p><strong>Iâ€™ve done my sharing and this is what was sent to Twitter:</strong></p>

<p>My message was no where to be found. Well I donâ€™t know if this is a bug, or if this is the way it should work. If itâ€™s a bug, itâ€™s really annoying, if not itâ€™s just plain stupid. Still if itâ€™s a bug that should be the standard message on Gowalla. Again, a story? Really?</p>

<p>Then I had another problem, a known problem already on the last version of gowalla. when youâ€™re checking in and you want to add a photo, you have to take a photo you canâ€™t simply add a pre-taken photo from your gallery. Guys this is a feature that is present on almost all the apps that let you add a photo to something.</p>

<p>And finally the last problem. I donâ€™t live in a big city, so thereâ€™s not that many spots, many of them I have to create them myself. I was on the app back and forth looking for the place to do that. Out of my frustration last night I sent a Tweet to gowalla and see if they could help me out. And they did.</p>

<p>Yes I was the one that couldnâ€™t find the option but Iâ€™m sorry to say, I still canâ€™t find the option on my Droid, maybe they took it out again on Android since that isnâ€™t the first time they do it.</p>

<p>And Iâ€™m telling you, I was one of those guys that added a lot of spots, and after that I always went to the website and correct the place, since gowalla never did a great job putting the spot on the right place, even with GPS on.</p>

<p>The Guide part of the app is great, I canâ€™t enjoy it where I live. But it looks great. But I still think the checkin process needs some real tuning.</p>

<p>So the main problem with Gowalla now is that it was great and now itâ€™s boring and unfriendly to use. Checking in should be a quick and painless process. And a story telling thingy.</p>

<p>Give me your thoughts on the new Gowalla app.</p>

<p>Also view the 3 articles on the Gowalla Blog since version 4 is out. Check the comments and youâ€™ll see that Iâ€™m not alone with this frustration.</p>
