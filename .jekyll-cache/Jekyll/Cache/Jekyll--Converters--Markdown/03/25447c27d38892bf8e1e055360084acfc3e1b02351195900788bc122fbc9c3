I"|<p>I had my blog on wardrobe and using a normal shared hosting for a long time. Worked out great for my blog and website. However later I’ve been playing more and more with static website generators and see what can be done with them.</p>

<p>With that in mind I decided to move both my website and blog to github hosting, for freeI might say and just use Jekyll to generate the static websites that I need.</p>

<p>The blog is really fast now, and everything works exactly like I want it.</p>

<p>I even used duckduckgo for the search functionality and it works amazing and with that I’m even supporting a really cool project.</p>
