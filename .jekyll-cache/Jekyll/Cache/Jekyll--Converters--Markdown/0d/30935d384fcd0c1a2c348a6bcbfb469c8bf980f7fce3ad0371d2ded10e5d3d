I"ý<p>Iâ€™ve created a small thumbnail helper for codeigniter and Iâ€™d like to get some feedback from you guys.</p>

<p><strong>Go nuts:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Propose changes (fork the thingy and make some changes or give it some nice features)</li>
  <li>Propose new features.</li>
</ul>

<p>Has you can see on the readme file I have some features coming up, I just need the time. For now you download, watch or fork it.</p>
