I"Q<p>If you’re a regular here you may have noticed that I’m always making some small improvements on my blog. The last one was quite simple, I just wanted to add some previous and next links when the user is reading an article. However, I wasn’t aiming to just simple arrows. I wanted to user to see the title of those articles.</p>
