I"û<p>Only a few days ago I found out about this feature. I was always typing my credentials every-time I wanted to push to a remote. Well, no more! With git-credential-store - Helper you can store credentials on disk.
<!--more-->
		$ git config credential.helper â€˜store [options]â€™</p>

<p>Using this helper will store your passwords unencrypted on disk, protected only by filesystem permissions. If this is not an acceptable security tradeoff thereâ€™s always git-credential-cache.</p>

<p><strong>git-credential-cache</strong></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>	$ git config credential.helper 'cache [options]'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This command caches credentials in memory for use by future git programs. The stored credentials never touch the disk, and are forgotten after a configurable timeout. The cache is accessible over a Unix domain socket, restricted to the current user by filesystem permissions.</p>

<p>There you go!</p>
