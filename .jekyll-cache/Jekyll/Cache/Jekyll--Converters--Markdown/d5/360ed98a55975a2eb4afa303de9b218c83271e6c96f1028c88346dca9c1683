<p>We all have our applications and we all want then to be always using the best tools, but most of all, we all want our content to get to everyone.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs why we add social sharing functionality, or iox capability so our application can turn into a web app in our phone. However, there are now more and more platforms to deal with, and many more to come. So today I‚Äôm going to give you a little snippet so you can turn your website into a HTML5 app. This way your website will run as a ‚Äúnative app‚Äù on the new Firefox OS.</p>

<p>Mozilla‚Äôs awesome new HTML5-based mobile operating system, Firefox OS, is going to be a game-changer in the mobile app space. No more needing to write ‚Äúnative‚Äù code for each device, no more reliance on PhoneGap to be a first-class device language. Better yet, essentially all you need to do to make your existing website or web app a Firefox OS app is add a manifest.webapp file to your domain which looks similar to this:</p>

 	 {
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>	"version": "1.0",
	"name": "Your App Name",
	"description": "Your new awesome HTML5-based mobile web app!",
	"launch_path": "/index.html",
	"icons": {
		"16": "/img/mylogo-16.png",
		"48": "/img/mylogo-48.png",
		"128": "/img/mylogo-128.png"
	},
	"developer": {
		"name": "Developer Name",
		"url": "http://yourawesomeapp.com"
	},
	"installs_allowed_from": ["*"],
	"locales": {
		"pt": {
			"description": "A minha nova app",
			"developer": {
				"url": "http://yourawesomeapp.com"
			}
		},
		"en": {
			"description": "My new web app",
			"developer": {
				"url": "http://yourawesomeapp.com"
			}
		}
	},
	"default_locale": "en"
  	}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It really can‚Äôt get any easier! To guard yourself against problem when your app is used offline, be sure to include the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Using_the_application_cache">HTML standard appcache</a> too!</p>
