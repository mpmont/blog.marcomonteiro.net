<p>Iâ€™ve been trying some stuff out on Laravel 3 and also Laravel 4. One thing that I like about laravel 3 is the use of bundles. Making it easy to re-use your code, which makes the application modular and so forth.
While in Codeigniter I never missed this feature, well at least not until I had a taste of what it really was using other frameworks. Now I think Iâ€™m going to try and use the HMVC pattern with Codeigniter.</p>

<p>When I first made my research I ended up here: codeigniter modular extensions hmvc after reading the wiki and talking about it with the folks at #codeigniter (Freenode) I think this is the way to go.

<strong>So what is this HMVC thing?</strong></p>

<p>Modular HMVC means modular MVC triads. Modular Separation and Modular Extensions allows related controllers, models, libraries, views, etc. to be grouped together in module directories and used like a mini application. But, Modular Extensions goes one step further and allows those modules to â€¦talkâ€œ to each other. You can get controller output without having to go out through the http interface again.
I think on my next project Iâ€™m going to stop using sparks and MVC. I shall embrace composer and HMVC. Until now Iâ€™ve been using composer and sparks at the same time but thatâ€™s gotta stop.</p>
