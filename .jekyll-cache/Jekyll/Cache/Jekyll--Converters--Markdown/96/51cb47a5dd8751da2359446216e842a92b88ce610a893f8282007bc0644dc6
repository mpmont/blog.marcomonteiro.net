I"<p>Every now and again we come across someone that can easily give us the <em>“Intern feeling”</em>. No, not the <em>“Bring me my coffee”</em> feeling. But more of someone that know so much about something that you just want to be around him or her to absorb everything.</p>

<p>This is probably one of the best things about working on the web development field. Nobody knows everything about the subject, but there’s always someone that knows a bit more than you do, and if you’re willing to learn and listen, you ca grow everyday.</p>

<p>He’s the thing that I’ll never understand, some people don’t like to be around others that clearly know more than they do about the subject. They feel rejected or inferior. I tell you what, if someday I’ll happen to take on a job where I’m the moron, and I’m the person that knows less about the stuff we’re working on, man I’ll be so happy (i’ll be sad if after a year i’m still the moron). Imagine learning something new everyday without even having to look for it. Just in your normal day job, talking with your peers.</p>

<p>Just be happy that you’re learning or have someone to learn from everyday.</p>
