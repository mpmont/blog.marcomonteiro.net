<p>Oh-my-zsh is a community driven framework that you can use to manage your zsh configuration.</p>

<p><strong>What about composer?</strong>
I have a blog you know? I write stuff from time to time. Keep up, Internet.</p>

<p><strong>The plugin!</strong>
This plugin is quite simple actually. It gives you auto-complete and a bunch of useful aliases:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>	c = 'composer'
	c  for autcomplete
	csu = 'composer self-update'
	cu = 'composer update'
	ci = 'composer install'
	ccp = 'composer create-project'
	cget = installs composer on the current path
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If youâ€™re looking for the composer commands you can see those <a href="http://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md">here</a>.</p>

<p>To add the plugin just make sure youâ€™re running the latest version of oh-my-zsh then edit your .zshrc file and add the composer plugin to the list of your active plugins.</p>

<p>There, done!</p>
