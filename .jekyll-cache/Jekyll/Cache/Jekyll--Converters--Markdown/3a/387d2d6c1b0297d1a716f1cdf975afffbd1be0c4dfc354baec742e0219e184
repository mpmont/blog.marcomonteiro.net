I"Ó<p>I started a brand new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9HQjernJPHN-RoKMwtYQ4w">youtube channel</a>. Itâ€™s called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9HQjernJPHN-RoKMwtYQ4w">TIL Things</a>. As in Today I Learned Things. The idea is to share kinda the same thing I normally do here but in a video format.</p>

<p>To start things, I decided to do a video series about Codeigniter 4, from how to install it, how it works and building a small blog application with it.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s the first video. I hope you can enjoy it and if you do please consider liking and subscribing.</p>

<p>All the code that will exist in these series will live in the following github repository.</p>
