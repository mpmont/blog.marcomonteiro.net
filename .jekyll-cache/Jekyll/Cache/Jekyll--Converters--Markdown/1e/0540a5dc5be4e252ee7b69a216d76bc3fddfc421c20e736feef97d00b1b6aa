I"e<p>I rarely use a Git UI. I mostly use within my text editor or in terminal. However when I do, I use gitkraken. I actually used source tree for a long time but ever since I moved to Linux this is my number one choice. Anyhow, this week I got a newsletter from the guys a gitkraken talking about LFS and I decided to show you guys what itâ€™s used for.</p>
