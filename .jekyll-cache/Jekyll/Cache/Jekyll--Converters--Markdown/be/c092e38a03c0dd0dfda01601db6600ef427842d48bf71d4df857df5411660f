I"V<p>I know, this is going to sound like a promotion post. Guess what, it is. I’m hosting my website (marcomonteiro.net) there for free so I guessed this was the least I could do for them.
So what so great about it?

<ul>
  <li>It’s not hosting, it’s a hosting framework.</li>
  <li>Priced based on monthly usage.</li>
  <li>Deployment of apps through a Git-based system.</li>
  <li>It’s beautiful.</li>
  <li>Scalable.</li>
  <li>Completely free for open source projects.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see since you pay depending on the resources you’re using, for a website like mine that is just html and I don’t really have many visits, most of them are here on tumblr I don’t even need a paid account.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a hosting at the moment, give it a go. For you and your clients.</p>

<p>Awesome right?</p>
