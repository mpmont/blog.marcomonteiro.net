<p>I was a hardcore online gamer for a while. Specially when I was in college (we all know how that is). However since I switched from Windows to OSX I stopped doing that. So I bought a xbox360 and now I do 90% of my gaming there. Even if I have some cool online games on Xbox I miss two types of games: Poker online and MMORPGâ€™s.

The first one I resolved it very quickly, found <a href="http://www.partypoker.com/">partypoker</a> since it was one of the few that actually had a pkg for a OSX app (most of the ones I found didnâ€™t) and the payment system works quite well.</p>
