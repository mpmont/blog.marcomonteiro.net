I"ž<p>Thatâ€™s right, I just won a VIP ticket to Laracon. Iâ€™m not going to lie - it would be hard for me to go without this. Being a portuguese developer is not that easy these days.

<p>I have almost everything sorted, just need to finish some final arrangements with hostel and Iâ€™m on my way.</p>

<p>Its going to be amazing I tell you. Iâ€™m going to be with a lot of the people I met during CIConf last year, and a lot of new people.</p>

<p>The line up for the event is awesome.</p>

<p><strong>Couple of things that I can tell you now about this trip.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Expect drunk tweets</li>
  <li><i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Expect some blogging during the events</li>
</ul>

<p>If youâ€™re going to be in the conference or are just in Amsterdam during that time and want to say hello, just let me know, both here or twitter, whatever works for you.</p>
