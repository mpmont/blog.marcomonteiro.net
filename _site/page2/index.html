                                <p>Codeigniter 4 has been in the works since 2015. It took almost 3 years to have a basic framework working and 2 more to document everything so we can use it in production. This is very exciting news, since codeigniter still holds a place in me. It was PHP framework that I use the most and I still use version 3 at work.</p>

                                <p>A few weeks ago I came across a problem that I haven’t had to deal with before. I was visiting a website on my computer, everything was normal. I could see all the information. That was exactly what I was expecting. Later that evening I wanted to show that website to a friend, but I was on my phone. When I got to the website on my phone I got this big message saying the website was not avaiable on my phone. As in, sure they didn’t bother to make a mobile version of the website and that’s ok. Instead they used the time they should be using to make a mobile version of that website to actually block all the users using smaller screens.</p>

<p>Seriously, just show me website in plain text. I wouldn’t mind that, really. Imagine my frustration if I happen to need your contacts. I pick up my phone, go to your website, and just got a message saying that</p>

                                <p>There’s a lot of ways to use Vagrant. Some people create a virtual machine per project. I don’t like that idea. I think it’s best to create a virtual machine for each different server you have to deploy. So if I have 2 projects that are going to be deployed to the same server why should I create two virtual machines? Makes no sense to me. Those two projects belong in the same virtual machine.</p>

                                <p>We all been at the place where we find a brand new project that is yet to come. We subscribe the newsletter to be up to date. The project dies, but somehow you keep getting those annoying emails, and doesn’t matter how many times we try to unsubscribe, we just can’t do it.</p>

<p>Unsubscribing from malling lists is probably the most annoying thing on the web today. I can’t count the times I tried to do so, and just can’t. Well, not anymore. Now I use Unroll.me.</p>

<p>With Unroll.me you can unsubscribe from most services in just a few clicks. Personally I unsubscribed from 105 malling lists. Most of them I wasn’t even getting any emails but just to be sure.</p>

<p>Do your self a favor and keep your inbox clean.</p>

<p><i class="icon-external-link"></i> <a href="https://unroll.me/">unroll.me</a></p>

<p>Use it and abuse it.</p>

One may be related to one class and the other to something completely different. Normally you should avoid that, your commits should <em>always</em> be specific to one task, feature or bug.

                                <p>When I started using Git I wasn’t doing any version control. I was just working on my projects and I just didn’t see any use to it. I wasn’t seeing the long run. Everything seemed like too much work — Branching, staging, stashing, committing — I was confused.  But then Git was kind forced on me, since I wanted to contribute to open source projects and almost all of them were (and still are thankfully) using Git I had to learn how to use it. This is what I learned from that process.</p>

Maybe we’re just too close to the project to even see the real problem. Or maybe, just maybe, we just need someone to talk to, share some ideas and the problem will solve itself.</p>

                                <p>I used to love Google Analytics, I’ve been using it for all my personal or client projects. However, the “new” version has been pissing me off more than usual. First I never got used to the new layout. Then the non integration with the google account that you normally have active it’s insane. If I have multiple accounts it always makes me logout from all of them and login with just one. If I’m using just one, it always make me hit the login button.</p>

                                <p>My tumblr experience ended. It was good while it lasted but we had to part ways. You changed the way people manage and write their posts and I didn’t like that one bit.</p>

<p>Then I found this little project called <a href="http://wardrobecms.com/">Wardrobe</a> built in Laravel 4 and I was in-love. Editor in markdown and a base templates focussed on the reading experience.</p>

<p>Took me one literally one days work to migrate all my articles and comments. First I used the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyllrb</a> plugin to export all my articles from tumblr. Then I imported everything into wardrobe in no time. The comments was the worst part, I had to change all the slugs to match them. After that I was good to go.</p>

<p>Couple of changes to the template and BAM I got myself a blog platform.</p>

<p>Best part is that since it’s built in Laravel 4 I can now play around with it and add more functionality to it.</p>

                                <p>Yeah, that’s right. If you’re like me you have a small compulsion to commit every small task you complete. In some cases that can be a good practice. However, when you’re working with a large team, or even on a open source project that has lot’s of contributors that can be a PITA in the long run. Imagine you’re looking for all the changes done while creating a feature, and your history is full of small commits. Finding what you’re looking for is not going to be easy.</p>

                                <p>First thing this morning (a little past midnight UK time), a guy by the name of Chris Borgia posted a campaign on indiegogo. The campaign, “Film Laracon” is pretty self-explanatory. In the project summary he pointed out that there were no plans for the talks to be recorded, meaning those of us unable to attend Laracon would be left out of the mix. As it happens, Chris already owns the relatively wide range of gear necessary to record a conference and he’d managed to secure a slot on the guest list, so all he had to cover was the cost of a hotel and parking at a total of $560.

                                <p>I just finished reading this book, so it’s now time to give it the review it deserves. First and foremost this is a really small book that you can read in hours. However you shouldn’t judge a book by its weight. Even though the book is small, it’s actually full of useful content.
Like any other book about a framework, it starts by walking the reader into the process of downloading and getting started with the framework. Getting everything ready on all the operating systems.
<!--more-->
The second part of the book walks the reader into making his own web-application. This is when it starts getting interesting. The thing I liked the most about the book is that Shawn didn’t focus on the usual subjects. He could’ve skipped the migrations subject entirely and just give the reader the necessary code to create the users table. But he didn’t, he used the migrations and moreover he explains the importance of using migrations while developing web-applications, especially while working with a team.</p>

                                <p>Well since I’m now working as a freelancer I now have a bit more power over what framework should be used for this or that project. Therefore, I think I’m not going to use Codeigniter by choice anymore. This means I’ll use it if the client requests it. Or if by any chance I’m working with someone else that is only familiar with CI and not Laravel.

Also I still need to support a lot of applications that were built with CI, and since the code doen’t re-write itself I’m going to continue with Codeigniter on those.</p>

<p>My fellow readers, you probably didn’t noticed but I’ve been off the grid for the last 2 or 3 weeks. I had a minor problem with my knee. My real knee, not my skyrim knee. Therefore, I wasn’t able to blog much for the past weeks. Or even try new things to blog about.</p>

<p>Ironically I made a new skyrim character during the past two weeks and I played a lot of xbox. But hey, I’m back to business now and it’s time to start over.</p>

<p>I’m planing a screencast series and I also have a few articles lined up. I’m excited about it. What about you?</p>

<p>I hope you’re still on the other side of the Interwebs waiting for my dumps of information.</p>

                                <p>I’ve been trying some stuff out on Laravel 3 and also Laravel 4. One thing that I like about laravel 3 is the use of bundles. Making it easy to re-use your code, which makes the application modular and so forth.</p>

<p>While in Codeigniter I never missed this feature, well at least not until I had a taste of what it really was using other frameworks. Now I think I’m going to try and use the HMVC pattern with Codeigniter.</p>

<p>When I first made my research I ended up here: codeigniter modular extensions hmvc after reading the wiki and talking about it with the folks at #codeigniter (Freenode) I think this is the way to go.</p>

<!--more-->

<p><strong>So what is this HMVC thing?</strong></p>

<p>Modular HMVC means modular MVC triads. Modular Separation and Modular Extensions allows related controllers, models, libraries, views, etc. to be grouped together in module directories and used like a mini application. But, Modular Extensions goes one step further and allows those modules to …talk“ to each other. You can get controller output without having to go out through the http interface again.</p>

<p>I think on my next project I’m going to stop using sparks and MVC. I shall embrace composer and HMVC. Until now I’ve been using composer and sparks at the same time but that’s gotta stop.</p>

<p>Lately I picked up on this thing called Yoda Conditions. I started using this on a new project I’ve been working on. First it was a bit odd I must say, but once I got into it boy do I love to declare my conditions like this.</p>

<p>The big upside from this is that when you’re reading the code you actually see the expected result first. You can actually see that on the image example.</p>

<p>The term “Yoda Conditions” was coined by <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/251153/zneak">zneak</a> a stackoverflow user.</p>

<p>The open-source world has learned to deal with a flood of new, oftentimes divergent, ideas using hosting services like GitHub — so why can’t governments? In this rousing talk Clay Shirky shows how democracies can take a lesson from the Internet, to be not just transparent but also to draw on the knowledge of all their citizens.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Clay Shirky argues that the history of the modern world could be rendered as the history of ways of arguing, where changes in media change what sort of arguments are possible — with deep social and political implications.</p>

<p>It did not take long after the rise of the commercial printing press before someone figured out that erotic novels were a good idea. â€¦ It took people another 150 years to even think of the scientific journal.</p>

All of them must be identified with two underscore prefix and they act as interceptors that will run then certain required conditions are met. So as you can see these methods are extremely useful.

From now on the two main subjects on my blog will be Composer and Unit Testing, since I decided that’s what I’m going to do next.
What is this thing called Composer?</p>

                                <p>In one of our breaks from the discussion “vi vs emacs” on the IRC Codeigniter channel we ended up discussing the slow release cycle of our favorite framework. There were some who didn’t like that about Codeigniter, but fortunately we had some people in the channel that were able to give some good points about the other side.
A lot of people don’t like that codeigniter is not in the cool kids group anymore. Well that’s ok, I bet the community using the framework was not using it just because it was cool (if you’re using it for that reason, you’re doing it wrong).

First let’s get some things out of the way. I love working with Codeigniter and I use it for almost all of my projects. But I’m not here to talk back at people that don’t use codeigniter. People should use what is best for them, or to the task they need to complete.</p>

Laravel is a clean and classy framework for PHP web development. Freeing you from spaghetti code, Laravel helps you create wonderful applications using simple, expressive syntax. Development should be a creative experience that you enjoy, not something that is painful. Enjoy the fresh air.</p>

                                <p>The CodeIgniter Handbook, a three-volume handbook full to the brim with pragmatic, succinct, useful information from one of the web’s pioneering developers. Learn about the whats &amp; whys of writing cleaner, more concise code. Discover fascinating new techniques that allow you to remove duplication, increase your programming efficiency, and reduce those repetitive tasks. Fall in love with CodeIgniter all over again.</p>

<p>In today’s world the focus in web development has firmly shifted from isolated systems to interconnected networks of applications, all talking to each other in real time. CodeIgniter’s flexibility makes it very easy to create Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and allow your applications to chat to each other.</p>

<p>In this book, you’ll learn the principles behind modern RESTful API design as well as a bunch of helpful implementation details, such as how to version your APIs, how to use HTTP to specify content types and how to extend and debug your APIs with useful homegrown tools.</p>

<p>I bought the 1st volume on paper when I was at Ciconf2012 UK, since Jamie Rumbelow does so much for the community I think the least I can do is buy his books. So this is what I’m currently reading, the second volume.</p>

<p>If you want to buy his book all you have to do is go <a href="https://efendibooks.com/">here</a> and do so. If you can’t afford the paper version the ebook version is quite cheap.</p>

One thing that I’m constantly doing is trying to improve my foo while using these two tools. Usually I’m on IRC talking with other developers that have the same interests, or just sharing lolcats. But every now and then, a guy shows up while we’re talking about Git and version control. I’m talking about a regular developer, a well intentioned one, that also wants to learn new stuff. But then he says the following:</p>

<p>Without any delay I added a list of all the contributors to the readme file. So if by any change you happen to contribute to the project in the future, be sure to add your name to the readme.</p>

<p>Once again, thank you.</p>

                                <p>Ever since Codeigniter moved from Bitbucket to Github I craved for one easy way to update my applications every time a new version gets out. Turns out there is none. And as you can see here, the updating process is always kinda boring specially if a major version is out. Since the version 3.0 is around the block I’m going to show you how I normally upgrade my codeigniter applications.

First things first, I’m assuming that you work with git in your normal day to day workflow. If you don’t use it, or even worst don’t know how to use it, stop reading this and without further delay go learn how to use it. (You can check this link for that!).</p>

<p>Tumblr looks like a good free option to me.</p>

                                <p>I was a hardcore online gamer for a while. Specially when I was in college (we all know how that is). However since I switched from Windows to OSX I stopped doing that. So I bought a xbox360 and now I do 90% of my gaming there. Even if I have some cool online games on Xbox I miss two types of games: Poker online and MMORPG’s.</p>

<p>The first one I resolved it very quickly, found <a href="http://www.partypoker.com/">partypoker</a> since it was one of the few that actually had a pkg for a OSX app (most of the ones I found didn’t) and the payment system works quite well.</p>

<p>Now the second part was not easy at all. First I found wurmonline but the java application was always crashing on mac. Then I tried Dungeon Hunter Alliance (bought it on the mac app store) and it is quite good.</p>

<p>So I think now I’m happy on my gaming thing. I have skyrim on my xbox, Party Poker to spend (or make) some money, and Dungeon Hunter Alliance to just hanging around and talk to some peeps.</p>

<p>Since I’ll be using sublime Text 2 on all my screencasts from now on, I thought I might do a little screencast about it first. I hope you enjoy.</p>

                                <p>When shorten url’s showed up for the first time they were great. We were starting the 140 characters era, and we wanted to share our stuff on the web. The problem was (and still is) that many url’s that point to the stuff we wanted to share were way to big. Just look at those url’s from amazon.</p>

<p>This is my first screencast, I’ve done it without any script. I used it just to try out the screencast software and to actually see if I should start doing this or just stay with the written articles.</p>

                                <p>You may noticed that a few weeks ago I removed the normal comment system from my blog and added Disqus to it. Mainly I did this because of this <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/marcogmonteiro/status/110787813687033856">tweet</a>. I was getting too much spam on my comments.</p>

                                <p>I’m a CodeIgniter lover, user and abuser. This is how I normally describe myself when I have to tell someone something about one of the greatest tools I’ve worked so far in webdevelopment and what I do with it. By now, if you worked with me at some point you know that I use CodeIgniter almost every day and I never get bored with it. And I hope to make you at the very least try it, if not, at least try to insight you in why I’m using it.

                                <p>A lot has been going on this year about responsive webdesign. Personally I think this is a great thing that finally webdesigners are awaken for the reality that webdesign can no longer be produced for one platform but for many.</p>

Also, CodeIgniter …Core“ is not longer being publicly maintained. CodeIgniter …Reactor“ is CodeIgniter, so we are dropping that suffix. In short: CodeIgniter is the framework, and Reactor is our community driven development program.</p>

<p>Lastly, version 2.0.3 was released today, download it <a href="http://codeigniter.com/download.php">here</a> or from the release tag at GitHub.</p>

Therefore this week post will be all about free stuff and all you can actually make with it on the webdesign / webdev world.

Ok now the next part and i’ll try to keep it clean and simple.

<p>I’m asking this because i have forgotten to add my feed to feedburner therefore i wasn’t able to monitor your subscriptions. Also now you can see all the post in my feed, because if you are like me you want to be able read almost everything just in your rss client.</p>

<p>I’m very sorry for the inconvenient but i think this will benefit both you and me.</p>
