Not yet. We still have time to look back. Yeah, it's that time of the year. Time to think back on what happened this last year. What went wrong and what went well.

**January <i class="icon-long-arrow-right"></i> April**

<i class="icon-angle-right"></i> The year started out greatly. The company I was working for was going down so I found myself without a job. Not even a month gone by and I found myself a new workplace and I'm still living [The CH Experience](http://blog.marcomonteiro.net/post/the-ch-experience). This made me move to another city, however not a strange city to me. A city that I do love with all my heart. After all, most of my friends are here and my best memories were created here.

Sure I wanted to go as a freelancer for a while. But that didn't work out so well so I'm glad that I am where I am now.

**May <i class="icon-long-arrow-right"></i> June**

<i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Moved my blog from Tumblr to [wardrobe](http://wardrobecms.com/) hosted by a Internet friend of mine that goes by the name freshpixel. You might've seen him on IRC. I've been improving my blog ever since with minor tweaks, making the theme responsive and some other cool features.  If you ever wanted a minimal blog application the way to go is definitely wardrobe. Thank you [Eric Barnes](https://twitter.com/ericlbarnes) for making such a beautiful platform.

**July <i class="icon-long-arrow-right"></i> August**

<i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Stopped using Google Analytics for personal projects, instead I'm using [piwik](http://piwik.org/). If you want something simple and that you have control over, this is the way to go. Even last week we got a new update with more awesome stuff.

**August <i class="icon-long-arrow-right"></i> September**

<i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Just a bit after that, I won a ticket to [LaraconEU](http://blog.marcomonteiro.net/archive?q=laracon) and of I went: next stop Amsterdam. Stuff was learn on that conference. But most of all, connections were made. Faces were put on nicknames and avatars. I hope I can keep this tradition of attending to (at least) one (abroad) conference every year. During 2013 laravel released its new version 4. Changing the game again. Using composer with all the things and once again pushing the PHP community forward.

**October <i class="icon-long-arrow-right"></i> November**

<i class="icon-angle-right"></i> I was internet famous for a couple of days. My post about the [Six months rule](http://blog.marcomonteiro.net/post/the-six-months-rule) went crazy on [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1pmzli/the_six_months_rule/) and I had 35k+ visits in just 48 hours. Thank you reddit.

**November <i class="icon-long-arrow-right"></i> December**

<i class="icon-angle-right"></i> I [won an award at work](http://blog.marcomonteiro.net/post/people-won-awards-that-day) during our christmas party.

It was definitely fast. All I can say is that this was a really good year. If the next one is has good as 2013 I think I'll be happy. I have a lot of different ideas for my blog for the upcoming months. Don't know if I'll be able to do them all. But I will definitely try.
