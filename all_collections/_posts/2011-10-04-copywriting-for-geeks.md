For the past weeks I've been reading some material about a lot of subjects on the web like SEO, Responsive Webdesign, SocialMedia and whatever piece of information I can get my hands on that can give a bit more know how about every aspects of the web. And last month I had a two weeks vacation (check the link to see everything I've accomplished from my todo list) I had some more time for the reading department. During that time I've come across with this book by Marc-André Cournoyer.

Now if you're familiar with Marc-André work you'll know before hand that this will be a nice reading. Even before you actually do some reading. Yes, he's that awesome.

So what's the book about?
Obviously I'm not giving you all the aspects of the book, you have to do the reading yourself. But I can leave you with some topics to spice things up a bit.

The eight principles of persuasion
This is the main topic of the book, every topic is well explained, therefore easy to understand. But the best thing about it is that Marc-André uses real examples on how to do it and how not to do it. It's amazing.

The secret of copywriting
This is actual just some final thoughts on the book.

The A/B testing
Some people are against this method some people love it. I love it, and I think it just works. And if you are against it you are just afraid of the outcome. Marc-André has a really good position about A/B testing.

In conclusion, I think this book is really good, you can go by all of it's content in one hour and I'm sure in the end you'll see that it was time well spent.
