Let's be clear, I'm still using OSX at work, mostly because there's no need to change there these days. The computer is already there, so why change?

For the past 8 or 9 years I've been using as my main computer a macbookpro. First gen I bought was awesome, lasted for years. Upgraded it with some more RAM, and then I even removed the DVD player (remember those?) and shoved a SSD and the computer was great.

Then I decided to sell it and bought one of the new ones. One of those that you can't really do anything to it (hardware wise). After some thought I decided it was time to make a decision, and believe it or not it all started with me selling my PS4. Sold it and decided to make a gamming rig. Then I also sold my new macbookpro and I was like  "-Man, I could make a hackingtosh!" So I made my gamming rig with all compatible parts and build it like that.

Bought a second SSD so I could have really separate environments, windows and OSX. Problem was, when I started fidling with the hackingtosh I got bored with it very fast.

Next logical step? I gave Ubuntu 17.10 a go and man was I impressed, everything is so fucking awesome with it. Works so well, they removed Unity that I always hated and got back to gnome 3.

My environment now is basically one hardrive with Linux and one with Windows 10 (that I actually kinda like too).

People, do you a favor if you're a developer start looking at other alternatives, because windows 10 and Linux really are these days.

I'll be posting more details about my environment soon.
