For a long time I’ve been using Jamie Rumbelow view presenters and after his presentation at Ciconf (London 2012) I noticed that a lot of people started using his code including my buddy David Wosnitza. After a while David started using the presenters in a even more clever way. He showed me his code and we agreed that it was time to create a library inspired in Jamie’s work.

**What is a presenter?**

A presenter just another layer of abstraction that works between the Controller and the View. 

**Why do we need another layer of abstraction?**

Because if you don’t you have two options, either you use a good template library, or you end up with messy views and those can be a pain to edit.
I made a small screencast that will help you understand better on how to use the ci-presenter library.

Fork it, add awesomeness to it and help document it. I’m the one doing all the documentation, so it would be great to have some help on that.
