That's right, I'm talking about the Codeigniter snippets package for sublime text. The package is now one of the top 100 most installed packages and it has 18k installs.

The package is compatible with both Sublime Text 2 and 3. So feel free to use it and add more awesomeness to it. The package has already most of the stuff that you'll need while using Codeigniter and Sublime Text. But I'm sure you have something to add.

Also, thank you!
