So I was passing by Seth’s Blog as I normally do from time to time. Normally I don’t care much for what he has to say because most of the stuff he says are just recycled material from his old material (it’s like inception, but boring). But every now and then he posts something that I can really enjoy.

**Here it is:**

> All artists are self-taught
> 
> Techniques and skill and even a point of view are often handed down, formally or not. It’s easier to get started if you’re taught, of course.
> 
> But art, the new, the ability to connect the dots and to make an impact—sooner or later, that can only come from one who creates, not from a teacher and not from a book.
> The article refer artists but you probably already know where I’m going with this. I’m a webdeveloper and I’m working as one for more than 3 years now. And I couldn’t agree more with this statement. Why? Because I think it’s safe to say that most of the stuff I know today was self thaught.
> 
> With this in mind I think programmers behave a lot like artists. That’s a good thing, however I also thing that not everything should be self-taught.
> 
> * Learn something new everyday. (The self-taught part)
> * Share your experiences.
> * Don’t be an asshole to people that are just beginning.
> * Point others to the right direction when you know what they’re looking for.
> * So in my opinion you should balance self-taught with learning with others.

I didn’t had that much to say, I only wanted to share Seth’s Idea here because I could’t do it in 140 characters if you know what I mean.

Tell me what you think about this, I’d love to learn with your experiences.
