I know, this is going to sound like a promotion post. Guess what, it is. I’m hosting my website (marcomonteiro.net) there for free so I guessed this was the least I could do for them.
So what so great about it?
<!--more-->
* It’s not hosting, it’s a hosting framework.
* Priced based on monthly usage.
* Deployment of apps through a Git-based system.
* It’s beautiful.
* Scalable.
* Completely free for open source projects.

As you can see since you pay depending on the resources you’re using, for a website like mine that is just html and I don’t really have many visits, most of them are here on tumblr I don’t even need a paid account.

If you’re looking for a hosting at the moment, give it a go. For you and your clients.

Awesome right?
