Last week I read one of those articles that you never want to read. Anthony Ferrara also known as [@ircmaxell](http://twitter.com/ircmaxell) on twitter left the Internals project.

I got to say, I never participated on the Internals discussions, I actually don't think I have the know-how to. So I preffer to leave that to the experts and not be the annoying noob in the room.

Anthony wrote a complete blog post explaining why he did what he did, and I got to say: after reading the post, I'm amazed by the time he did stay there.

So, if you're a PHP developer go read his article and give him your support on twitter.
