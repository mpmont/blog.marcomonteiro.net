Over the weekend I’ve written a small helper since latterly almost all of my projects have to work with youtube or even with vimeo. This is a helper to work with Codeigniter obviously.

Has usual I’ll give you guys the link to github. If you have any suggestions or have any issues with it, just post it on github. Also you’re free to fork it and add awesomeness to it.
