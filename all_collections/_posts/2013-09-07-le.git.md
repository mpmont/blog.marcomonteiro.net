I'm a big git flow fan, no doubt about that. I use it every day and I still think that it is the perfect way to work with a team of people. But, from time to time, you find yourself working on a small project. One that you're just going to hack during the weekend and you want something simpler. 

[Legit](http://www.git-legit.org/) (Git workflow for humans) got you covered.

Basically it works like this:

	$ git sync
	# Synchronizes current branch. Auto-merge/rebase, un/stash.

	$ git switch <branch>
	# Switches to branch. Stashes and restores unstaged changes.

	$ git publish <branch>
	# Publishes branch to remote server.

	$ git unpublish <branch>
	# Removes branch from remote server.

	$ git branches
	# Nice & pretty list of branches + publication status.
	
See how easy it to work with a feature branch?

Now let's say you want to install it and start using it, if you use [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) like myself then once again I got you covered.

	$ brew install legit
	To enable the git aliases:

	$ legit install

Nice and simple â€” the way it should be.
