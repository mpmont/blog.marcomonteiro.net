Elislab wanted to focus their development into the product that actually made them money. Nothing wrong about that. They started to look for a someone to take care of Codeigniter. The community started to panic. Months have passed and finally codeigniter has a new home.

> The British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT) in Vancouver, Canada is a highly regarded applied technology institute with 48,000 full and part-time students. Their impressive BCIT School of Computing and Academic Studies teaches CodeIgniter to 150 students a year. Now, they are its stewards.

This was a great announcement in my opinion. As soon as they started to move their stuff into the new repo, and even get a new website everyone got excited again. Things are starting to move again.

The CodeIgniter project has an interim council, to oversee the release of CodeIgniter 3 and to steer the framework to the next level.

* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i> **Andreas Pfotenhauer** - Although I never met him in real life I think of him as a wise friend from the #codeigniter freenode channel.
* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i> **Andrey Andreev** - Our codeigniter hero, keep going buddy
* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i> **Ben Edmunds** - I've been using his code for years, he's a great addition to the project
* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i> **David Wosnitza** - Long term Codeigniter user and abuser like myself
* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i> **Jim Parry** - He's the one in charge now, good luck to you
* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i> **Lonnie Ezell** - Another great addition to the project

Iâ€™m happy that Pfotenhauer, Andrey, David, and Ben are on this. All stand up guys that have done a lot for the framework over the years either helping with the development or just helping or advising others on IRC.
