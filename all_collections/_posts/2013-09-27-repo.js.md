We are developers, we have personal websites, blogs and all that. So from time to time, we want to embed in a blog post or any other type of content a bit of code. There's a lot of ways to do so. For instance on my blog I use [highlight.js](http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/). It works fine I don't have a single complaint about it.

However, what if I had a bunch of files I needed to show inside a blog post or even more, imagine I want to show a hole github repository inside a blog post?

Well repo.js is here to save the day.

All you need to do is add the javascript library into your website. Then you can just do:

	$('#repo').repo({ user: 'mpmont', name: 'ci-snippets' });

That should be all.
