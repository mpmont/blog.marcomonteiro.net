On the second part of the first day, Jordi Boggiano took the stage. Jordi is a lead developer of Composer, the PHP dependency manager that has taken the PHP world by storm.

**In-Depth with Composer** was the name of his talk.

So as expected his talk was all about composer. As you can see in his talk [here](http://joind.in/9028) it was mostly about tricks and tips about it.

One of the best quotes so far from his talk was probably this one:

> It's cool to be bleeding edge, but it's bleeding for a reason.

I couldn't agree more. People should be careful while using beeding edge tecnology. Specially with composer packages.
