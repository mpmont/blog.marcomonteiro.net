I rarely use a Git UI. I mostly use within my text editor or in terminal. However when I do, I use gitkraken. I actually used source tree for a long time but ever since I moved to Linux this is my number one choice. Anyhow, this week I got a newsletter from the guys a gitkraken talking about LFS and I decided to show you guys what it's used for.

Git LFS stands for Large File Storage and is a tool many developers use to save space when working with binary files.

Here's a small video explaining the concept and how to use it in gitkraken.

If you never used [gitkraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) I really recomend you give it a go.
