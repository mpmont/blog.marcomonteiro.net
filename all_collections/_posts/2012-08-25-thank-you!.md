I’m just here to tell you that the Codeigniter Snippets package for Sublime Text 2 just reached the 6400+ installs. This couldn’t be possible without the awesome community that Codeigniter has. Therefore I think it’s appropriate to thank everyone that supported the project, and most of all, the contributors.

Without any delay I added a list of all the contributors to the readme file. So if by any change you happen to contribute to the project in the future, be sure to add your name to the readme.

Once again, thank you.
