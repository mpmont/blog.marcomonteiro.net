In today's world the focus in web development has firmly shifted from isolated systems to interconnected networks of applications, all talking to each other in real time. CodeIgniter's flexibility makes it very easy to create Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and allow your applications to chat to each other.

In this book, you'll learn the principles behind modern RESTful API design as well as a bunch of helpful implementation details, such as how to version your APIs, how to use HTTP to specify content types and how to extend and debug your APIs with useful homegrown tools.

I bought the 1st volume on paper when I was at Ciconf2012 UK, since Jamie Rumbelow does so much for the community I think the least I can do is buy his books. So this is what I’m currently reading, the second volume.

If you want to buy his book all you have to do is go [here](https://efendibooks.com/) and do so. If you can’t afford the paper version the ebook version is quite cheap.
