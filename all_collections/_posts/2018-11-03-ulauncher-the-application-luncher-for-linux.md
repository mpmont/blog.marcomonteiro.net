Ever since I moved away from mac and started using Linux as my daily driver there's been a few minor things that I miss obviously. One of the things is that I never really liked the default application launcher for ubuntu. I always loved the default one mac os has that has a lot of built in functionality. Or if you wanted more on mac you could even install Alfred and that was awesome too.

So I looked a bit more and found out that you can have the exact same thin on Linux and its called Ulauncher.

It was basic feature like:

**Fuzzy search**

Type in an application name without worrying about spelling. Ulauncher will figure out what you meant. It also remembers your previous choices and automatically selects the best option for you.

**Custom color themes**

Ulauncher provides 4 themes built in. But if you need something different you can always [create a custom color theme](https://gist.github.com/gornostal/02a232e6e560da7946c053555ced6cce). Docs are [here](http://docs.ulauncher.io/en/latest/themes/themes.html).

**Shortcuts & extensions**

Improve your workflow with customizable shortcuts and extensions. Create a shortcut for web search or your scripts or install a 3rd party extension.

**Fast directory browser**
Browse files and directories with ease.  Type ~ or / to start. Press Alt+Enter to access an alt menu.

Assuming you're using debian you can just download the .deb file and install the thing.
