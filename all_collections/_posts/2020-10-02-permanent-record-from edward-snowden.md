In case you've been living under a rock and don't know who Edward Snowden is then I don't know what to tell you.

Edward Snowden have been a hero of mine for a few years now, I really admire the courage it took from him to do what he did. Earlier this year to took uppon myself to listen to his book and my God, what a ride. The life this man is living is out of this world.

The book describes Snowden's childhood as well as his tenure at the Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency and his motivations for the leaking of highly classified information in 2013 that revealed global surveillance programs. Snowden also discusses his views on authoritarianism, democracy and privacy. The writer Joshua Cohen is credited by Snowden for "helping to transform my rambling reminiscences and capsule manifestoes into a book.

If you really want to know more about im I advise you to read the book or listen to it like I did. If that's not something that you're incline to do, then just listen to these two podcasts when he was on Joe Rogan.
