Do you use bootstrap? Who am I kidding, of course you do.

Ok, here’s the problem that I used to have: I build a lot of back-end applications, most of them are powered by booststrap and one thing that I always found was that it didn’t had many icons to work with.

That’s were Font awesome comes in. You just need to include another css file and you’re done. Now you can use many, many icons and better than that. You can use them in different sizes.

How awesome is that?

Use it and abuse it.
