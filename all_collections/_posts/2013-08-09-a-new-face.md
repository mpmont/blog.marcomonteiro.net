My tumblr experience ended. It was good while it lasted but we had to part ways. You changed the way people manage and write their posts and I didn't like that one bit.

Then I found this little project called [Wardrobe](http://wardrobecms.com/) built in Laravel 4 and I was in-love. Editor in markdown and a base templates focussed on the reading experience.

Took me one literally one days work to migrate all my articles and comments. First I used the [jekyllrb](http://jekyllrb.com/) plugin to export all my articles from tumblr. Then I imported everything into wardrobe in no time. The comments was the worst part, I had to change all the slugs to match them. After that I was good to go.

Couple of changes to the template and BAM I got myself a blog platform.

Best part is that since it's built in Laravel 4 I can now play around with it and add more functionality to it.
