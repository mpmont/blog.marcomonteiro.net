Last week I noticed this indie game on Nintendo Switch at just 1.99 euros. After seeing just a few clips on youtube I bought it at started playing. Man, what a ride.

This game has just about everything I love in a game. It's hard but not stupid hard, you just have to take your time learning patterns. The puzzles are just amazing and the artwork? The artwork it's just perfect. Oh and have I told you about the sound track? The sound track takes you into a deep depression that you know your character is in. Ah right, the story. It's pretty basic. Scientist loses wife aka love of his live and goes on a quest to revive her at all cost. That's it.

Anyhow, if you have time and love this kind of game just give it a go.
