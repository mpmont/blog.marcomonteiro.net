Full HD displays? Eat your heart out, handset manufacturers. LG Display has just laid claim to the world's first Quad HD (2,560 x 1,440) smartphone display, which also boasts the highest pixel density of a mobile device, clocking in at 538ppi.

Do you even know what this means for developers, specially front-end developers that do a lot of responsive webdesign? This means that a little device like that has more pixels than most 27" displays! So we're heading towards huge images for phones and normal ones for desktops... This. Is. Insane.

Apple's retina displays is 326ppi and we already have enough trouble with it. This is almost double the size. The web will look awful using this LG screen.

Just saying.
