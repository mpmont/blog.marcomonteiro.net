PuPHPet is a simple GUI to set up virtual machines for PHP development.

This is a gui configurator for the [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/) automation tool. It uses [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/) as the provisioning backend.
This is similar to another tool that recently came out, [Rove.io](http://rove.io/), although that one is more focused on using Vagrant with Chef, and has different configuration options.
