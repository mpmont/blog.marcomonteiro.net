Oh my, did you noticed that Laracon is right around the corner? That's right, next week I'll be traveling to Amsterdam for a small geek gathering. 

I look forward to check out the city, that's why I'm going to stay there for a couple extra days. Also I'll be with some of the people that went with me to Ciconf last year. But, most of all I can't wait to met new people. People that I talk almost every week on twitter or IRC and the ones that I don't even know about.

There's always that awkward feeling when you put a face on a avatar. But you know what the best part is? Going to conferences like this one, even if you're a guru that wrongly thinks that has nothing to learn, you always do. 

I look forward to learn with you.
