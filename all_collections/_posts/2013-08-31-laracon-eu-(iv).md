The second day had some really good talks. However there's one that want to talk for a bit.

>Ben Corlett is the lead engineer at Cartalyst, Director of Webcomm and developer for Kapture. His days typically involve a mix of developing the hottest Composer-based PHP packages and applying the theoretical use of the newest technologies, frameworks and code in real-world scenarios.

Once again the subject was all about composer. But this time it was more about how to build new packages, good practices and whatnot.

One of the things that composer tries to achieve is cross framework code. To achive this you have to follow on simple rule:

> Your code **must** be framework agnostic.

This is quite easy to understand. Makes no sense to build Laravel libraries, or Codeigniter libraries. We should be all building packages that can be used by any framework.

One other point that Ben talked a lot was how do you go about making a decision to make a new package. He even made a graph and all.
