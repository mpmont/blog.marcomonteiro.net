Need a placeholder? Like kittens? Use Codeigniter?

Well youâ€™ve come to the right place sir. I have just the thing for you. Today edmundask did his own placeholder helper for Codeigniter. When I saw it I just had to make a placeholder with kittens. So I forked his repository and did it.

Hope you enjoy it.
