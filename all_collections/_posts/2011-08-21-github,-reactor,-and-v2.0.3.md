If you are following [CICON 2011](http://cicon2011.com/) yesterday, then you no doubt already heard from the Reactor team: CodeIgniter is now using Git for source control, and has moved its [home to GitHub](https://github.com/EllisLab/CodeIgniter). Also, CodeIgniter ...Core“ is not longer being publicly maintained. CodeIgniter ...Reactor“ is CodeIgniter, so we are dropping that suffix. In short: CodeIgniter is the framework, and Reactor is our community driven development program.

Lastly, version 2.0.3 was released today, download it [here](http://codeigniter.com/download.php) or from the release tag at GitHub.
For full details of our switch to Git, head over to the [EllisLab blog](http://ellislab.com/blog/comments/ellislab_switches_to_git_moves_to_github).
