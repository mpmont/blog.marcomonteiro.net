A few weeks ago I reported that I made the change from Mac to Linux. Since then I tested loads of stuff in Linux to the point where I choose my stuff. Later Ubuntu 18.04 came out and I decided to do a clean install with just the software I wanted.

Here's the result.

Linux Distro: [Ubuntu 18.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/)

First thing I did was change the layout and to do that I started with Gnome Tweak Tool.

<i class="icon-terminal"></i> sudo apt install gnome-tweak-tool

Here's my appearance settings:

On my desktop tab I have everything on (show icons, home, network servers, trash and mounted volumes).

Then some extensions were installed:

* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i>Audio output switcher (I can change the output from headset to speakers)
* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i>Clipboard indicator (have a clipboard history)
* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i>Coverflow Alt-Tab (a fancy alt+tab menu)
* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i>Custom corner (custom corner shortcuts)
* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i>Dropdown Terminal (terminal opening on top of everything with shortcut)
* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i>Flippery Move Clock (move the clock to the right)
* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i>OpenWeather (weather in the top menu)
* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i>Panel OSD (custom notifications)
* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i>Places Status Indicator (places menu)
* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i>Remove Dropdown Arrows (remove the dropdown arrows to have extra space)
* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i>Status area horizontal spacing (reduce horizontal space)
* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i>Ubuntu AppIndicators (always how indicators of the app you're using)
* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i>Ubuntu Dock (already came with the system)
* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i>Dash to Panel (save them pixels and use just one bar)
* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i>Suspend button (adds the suspend button to the gnome menu)

On my Top Bar I left only the applications Menu and Date. Everything else was removed. Layout wise was only a few more changes to do, those were made with the system wide settings menu.

Here's the final look.

Now, on to the apps I installed to help with my day to day use.

* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Mailspring (email client)
* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Sublime Text 3
* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Atom
* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Discord
* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Terminator
* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Quassel IRC
* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i> VLC media player
* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Caffeine
* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i> GitKraken
* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i> FreeOffice

Only thing I'm still testing is a database managing software like Sequel Pro. I really loved that app on Mac.

Anything else I'm missing? Let me know!
