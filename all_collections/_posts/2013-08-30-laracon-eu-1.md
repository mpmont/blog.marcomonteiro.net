We gathered at the beautiful Bimhuis. After we all got our credentials and whatnot ready it was time to start.

Phill Sparks Opened the conference with a really good talk about Software Design Patterns in Laravel 4. He's a member of the Laravel Core Team with shared responsibility for community engagement and support. Throughout the talk the showed many examples on those Patterns and how they are used inside Laravel. That was pretty cool.

Then Jeffrey Way took the stage with his talk about Laravel Testing Tips, Techniques and Pitfalls. The talk wasn't that much about Laravel, but more about testing in general and how to use it in the real world. But most of all he talked on how to get into it and get started. He had loads of examples.

Right now, Taylor Otwell is doing a small Q&A about Laravel and general development actually.

I'm pretty sure all the talks will be avaiable soon.
