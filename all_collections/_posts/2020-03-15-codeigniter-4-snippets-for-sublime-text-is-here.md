Codeigniter 4 has been in the works since 2015. It took almost 3 years to have a basic framework working and 2 more to document everything so we can use it in production. This is very exciting news, since codeigniter still holds a place in me. It was PHP framework that I use the most and I still use version 3 at work.

With this new version up its time to make a new snippets package for Sublime Text 3. I've been maintaning the first version of that package for some years now. [Back then it had 6400+ installs](https://blog.marcomonteiro.net/post/thank-you!) and I thought that was big, now it has[ more than 126k](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/CodeIgniter%20Snippets).

Let's make the new one has big as the first one. I made a repo here, and I already have a [pull request](https://github.com/wbond/package_control_channel/pull/7845) to have it avaiable to everyone via package control. Until then you can just install it manually. To do that you just have to make a clone of this repository into your packages folder **(Preferences > Browse packages...)**, like so:

    git clone https://github.com/mpmont/ci4-snippets ci4-snippets

If you feel like helping, you can just send me a pull request and we can sort something out.

You can know more about Codeigniter 4 by [checking the docs](https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/). And the [official release post](https://forum.codeigniter.com/thread-75581.html) in the forums.
