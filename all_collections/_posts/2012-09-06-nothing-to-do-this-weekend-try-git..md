Over the last month I blogged about a lot of stuff that is related to code versioning in one way or another. I think it’s clear by now that the best tool out there for that is Git (this is just my humble opinion).

The post called “Git vs SVN is it really a battle?" created a lot of discussion both on my blog and on forrst and that made me really happy. With all that discussion I noticed something, people that were not using git all said the same thing in one way or another.
Git is hard to learn.

Well I don’t really agree with that. But now you can learn git in an intuitive way. You don’t even need to setup anything, just fire-up your browser of choice (if that’s Internet Explorer, please kill yourself before the tutorial, it’s the 1st step) and you can start playing around with git.

Remember, all the ladies want these days is a Jedi Git master. So [Try Git](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git).
