Personally I use PHP everyday. It has a lot of things that I don't like. It's not the best language in the world, it not perfect. However, it's flexible and easy to start with. 

The thing I hate more about using PHP is the amount of people that have the following hobby:

> I shall hate PHP and every PHP developer for a living.

We find these assholes everyday: on forums, twitter and anywhere you can think of.

Problem is, these guys don't really know how PHP works these days. They've been using the same arguments for years and years. But PHP evolved, so much so, that there's a whole project about it.

[PHP the right way](http://www.phptherightway.com/) is the one you should be looking at.

>There’s a lot of outdated information on the Web that leads new PHP users astray, propagating bad practices and insecure code. PHP: The Right Way is an easy-to-read, quick reference for PHP popular coding standards, links to authoritative tutorials around the Web and what the contributors consider to be best practices at the present time.

>There is no canonical way to use PHP. This website aims to introduce new PHP developers to some topics which they may not discover until it is too late, and aims to give seasoned pros some fresh ideas on those topics they’ve been doing for years without ever reconsidering. This website will also not tell you which tools to use, but instead offer suggestions for multiple options, when possible explaining the differences in approach and use-case.

**PHP the Right way** is a living document and will continue to be updated with more helpful information and examples as they become available.

If you're a PHP developer, you can be a better one by taking a look at this project. If you're one of those annoying assholes, you can now be an informed one.
