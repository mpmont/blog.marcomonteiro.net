Yeah, that’s right. It’s gone, vanish, it’s in fact the past now. So let’s look back and see what 2012 as done.

I started this blog in late 2010. Rather than dumping all the information I wanted here, I had a really slow start. Blogging only every now and them. Actually 2010 had only 8 posts and for some weird reason that I can’t really remember my next post only came 6 months after that.
So 2011 was also a slow year. Them I made one of my 2012 year resolutions that I’ll be using my blog more often.

Then I started planning and taking it more seriously, doing series of posts about specific subjects. Screencasting, which was weird for me (still is), and yes, 2012 has more posts (with what I think is useful information) than the other two years put together.

The only thing I really wish for 2013 related to this project is making it even better. Like I told you I’m planing a screencast series, something that I haven’t done before. Also I’m going to keep posting like I did during 2012 or better, time will tell.

For now, thanks for stoping by and I wish you a really good 2013.
