I’ve created a small thumbnail helper for codeigniter and I’d like to get some feedback from you guys.

**Go nuts:**

* Propose changes (fork the thingy and make some changes or give it some nice features)
* Propose new features.

Has you can see on the readme file I have some features coming up, I just need the time. For now you download, watch or fork it.
