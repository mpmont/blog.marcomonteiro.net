The book is a guide to Laravel aimed at beginners to the framework who already have some PHP experience. It is structured in the form of guides to core features and stand-alone tutorials. It was written by a core developer of the Laravel framework, and has the support of the framework author.

Please note that this is a publish in progress title, eztra chapters may be added at a later date and it will be updated to support future versions of Laravel for free.

The pricing scheme is a little special, the base price for the book is set at $9.99, however the suggested price is set to Â£99.99. The suggested price is NOT suggested, that is simply the label that the site uses.

If you would like to pay more than the minimum to support my writing, please do!

Thanks!

Yeah, I bought the book! Now I really need to start learning this thing for real. If you want to support Dayle Rees, he does a lot for the Laravel community you should consider buying his book.
