Hi everyone! The good people of the #Laravel IRC channel came up with the idea to start a Laravel Study Group!

We're exploring one discrete topic per day to increase our mastery of Laravel. Follow us here or at http://twitter.com/laravelio and check every week day for our new topic.

The laravel Freenode channel has been quite active recently (at #laravel), mostly due to the work done from all the core members of Laravel. Taylor is writing code like a crazy chiwawa. Shawn and Dayle wrote books and now Shawn is running this “small” project. If you’re starting with Laravel and want to learn more just drop by and show them some love.

Also there’s still some work to be done on the website, in case you want to be a part of something and help out with the project, just talk to Shawn on Twitter or Freenode.
