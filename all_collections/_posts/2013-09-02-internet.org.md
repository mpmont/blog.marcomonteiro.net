Apparently Facebook has a new pet. It's called *The Internet*. The project has actually some good points.

Internet.org is a global partnership between technology leaders, nonprofits, local communities and experts who are working together to bring the internet to the two thirds of the world’s population that doesn’t have it.

It all sounds really good. Until...

I saw their video campaign, and that got me a bit mad. Call me closed minded or even lunatic, I don't care. But that video showed the armpits of the world. I know they're trying to do a good thing. But shouldn't we be more worried about getting food or... I don't know: electricity and drinkable water instead of lolcats?

I know the Internet is way more than lolcats, there's also porn.

We know for a fact that this is true:

> "The internet boosts economic, social and political development, and contributes to the progress of humankind as a whole.”

All I'm saying is that this is a good thing, but maybe we ought focus on more important things.

> "Making the internet available to every person on earth is a goal too large and too important for any one company, group, or government to solve alone. Internet.org’s partners have come together to meet this challenge because they believe in the power of a connected world."

Another great point, but I think I can see who's going to benefit from this first. Let's just take a look at the partners.

* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Mediatek
* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Opera Software
* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Samsung
* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i> facebook
* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Nokia
* <i class="icon-angle-right"></i> Qualcomm

Anyway, don't take this the wrong way. Again, I think this is a good thing, but… priorities.
