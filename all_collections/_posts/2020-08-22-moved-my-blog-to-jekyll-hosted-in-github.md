I had my blog on wardrobe and using a normal shared hosting for a long time. Worked out great for my blog and website. However later I've been playing more and more with static website generators and see what can be done with them.

With that in mind I decided to move both my website and blog to github hosting, for freeI might say and just use Jekyll to generate the static websites that I need.

The blog is really fast now, and everything works exactly like I want it.

I even used duckduckgo for the search functionality and it works amazing and with that I'm even supporting a really cool project.
