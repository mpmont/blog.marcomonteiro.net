I started a brand new [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9HQjernJPHN-RoKMwtYQ4w). It's called [TIL Things](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9HQjernJPHN-RoKMwtYQ4w). As in Today I Learned Things. The idea is to share kinda the same thing I normally do here but in a video format.

To start things, I decided to do a video series about Codeigniter 4, from how to install it, how it works and building a small blog application with it.

Here's the first video. I hope you can enjoy it and if you do please consider liking and subscribing.
